Give examples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The entry modifier allows a function to be called directly from a programmable transaction block, as an 'entrypoint' to the module. When called this way, parameters passed to entry functions must be inputs to the transaction block, not the results of previous transactions in that block, and not modified by previous transactions in that block. Entry functions are also only allowed to return types that have drop. These restrictions prevent third parties using the scriptable nature of programmable transaction blocks to bypass the fact that entry functions are not otherwise allowed to be called from other modules. \n\npublic vs entry functions\nThe public modifier also allows a function to be called from a programmable transaction block. It additionally allows the function to be called from other modules, and does not impose the same restrictions on where the function's parameters can come from and what it can return, so in many cases public is the right way to expose your function to the outside world. entry is useful if:\n- You want strong guarantees that your function is not being combined with third-party module functions, in programmable transaction blocks. The canonical example of this is a swap protocol that does not want to interact with a flash loan provider: If the swap protocol exposes only entry functions to perform swaps, it will not be possible to pass in a flash loaned Coin, because that coin will be the output of some previous transaction.\n- You do not want the function's signature to appear in your module's ABI. public function signatures must be maintained by upgrades while entry function signatures do not.\n\nIt is also possible to create a public entry function, which can be called by other modules and by programmable transaction blocks but is restricted like an entry function in the latter case. This is rarely useful -- you probably only want one of public or entry. \n\nExample\n ```move\nmodule entry_functions::example {\n    use sui::object::{Self, UID};\n    use sui::transfer;\n    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};\n\n    struct Foo has key {\n        id: UID,\n        bar: u64,\n    }\n\n    /// Entry functions can accept a reference to the `TxContext`\n    /// (mutable or immutable) as their last parameter.\n    entry fun share(bar: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext) {\n        transfer::share_object(Foo {\n            id: object::new(ctx),\n            bar,\n        })\n    }\n\n    /// Parameters passed to entry functions called in a programmable\n    /// transaction block (like `foo`, below) must be inputs to the\n    /// transaction block, and not results of previous transactions.\n    entry fun update(foo: &mut Foo, ctx: &TxContext) {\n        foo.bar = tx_context::epoch(ctx);\n    }\n\n    /// Entry functions can return types that have `drop`.\n    entry fun bar(foo: &Foo): u64 {\n        foo.bar\n    }\n\n    /// This function cannot be `entry` because it returns a value\n    /// that does not have `drop`.\n    public fun foo(ctx: &mut TxContext): Foo {\n        Foo { id: object::new(ctx), bar: 0 }\n    }\n}```"}]}

This requirement is based on a simple fact that the TransferRequest issued on purchase must be resolved in a matching TransferPolicy and if there isn't one or buyer can't access it, the transaction will fail. \n\n This system was designed to give maximum freedom and flexibility for creators: by taking the transfer policy logic out of the trading primitive we make sure that the policies can be set only by creators, and as long as the trading primitive is used, enforcements are under their control. Effectively creators became closer to the trading ecosystem and got an important and solid role in the process."}, {"role": "assistant","content": "**Architecture** \n By default, a single TransferPolicy does not enforce anything - if a buyer attempts to confirm their TransferRequest, it will go through. However, the system allows setting so-called \"Rules\".

Each Lottery is a shared object in which the creator receives a `WithdrawalCapability` \n    which can be used to withdraw the ticket sales once the lottery has been run and a winner has \n    been announced.\n\n    Creating a lottery:\n        A lottery is created using the `create` entry function which requires the transfer of an NFT \n        and other parameters for the lottery, such as length in time, prize per ticket and the upper \n        range of ticket numbers. A `Lottery` shared object is created which defines the parameters \n        of the lottery, holds the NFT prize and collects ticket payments. The `WithdrawalCapability` \n        allows the owner of this object to withdraw from the corresponding `Lottery` once it has \n        successfully run.\n    \n    Buying a ticket:\n        Once a lottery is created, any user can purchase a ticket and will receive a `LotteryTicket` \n        as proof of this purchase. The user can select any number that they wish as long as the \n        number hasn't already been sold and is within the range specified for the lottery. Payment \n        is in SUI and must be greater or equal than the price per ticket for the lottery.\n\n    Running the lottery:\n        Anyone can run the lottery if and only if the end date has passed. Tickets for the lottery \n        aren't available for purchase after the lottery has been run.  A pseudorandom number is \n        generated on chain and if there is a match to one of the bought tickets the lottery is \n        complete and the winner may collect their prize via `claim_prize`.  If no match is found \n        then the `run` entry function can be called until a winner is found. \n\n        A lottery cannot be run if it has already been run, if the end date has not passed, or if \n        the minimum number of participants has not been reached.\n\n    Cancellation period:\n        A lottery may be cancelled by anyone if the lottery has not been run and it is at least 7 \n        days past the end date. If the lottery has been cancelled, the creator can receive their NFT \n        back and players can refund their purchased tickets.\n    \n    Burning tickets:\n        At any point, the owner of a ticket can burn their ticket. \n    \n*/\nmodule overmind::nft_lottery {\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Dependencies - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n    use sui::event;\n    use sui::sui::SUI;\n    use sui::transfer::{Self};\n    use sui::object::{Self, UID, ID};\n    use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};\n    use sui::clock::{Self, Clock};\n    use sui::tx_context::TxContext;\n    use std::option::{Self, Option};\n    use sui::vec_set::{Self, VecSet};\n    use sui::balance::{Self, Balance};\n    \n    \n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Constants - Add your constants here (if any)\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Error codes - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n    /// No LotteryCapability\n    const ENoWithdrawalCapability: u64 = 1;\n    /// Invalid range\n    const EInvalidRange: u64 = 2;\n    /// In the past\n    const EStartOrEndTimeInThePast: u64 = 3;\n    /// Lottery has already run\n    const ELotteryHasAlreadyRun: u64 = 4;\n    /// Insufficient funds\n    const EInsufficientFunds: u64 = 5;\n    /// Ticket Already Gone\n    const ETicketAlreadyGone: u64 = 6;\n    /// No prize available\n    const ENoPrizeAvailable: u64 = 7;\n    /// Not winning number\n    const ENotWinningNumber: u64 = 8;\n    /// Ticket Not Available\n    const ETicketNotAvailable: u64 = 9;\n    /// Not withing conditions to abort\n    const ENotCancelled: u64 = 10;\n    /// Invalid number of participants\n    const EInvalidNumberOfParticipants: u64 = 11;\n    /// Ticket not found\n    const ETicketNotFound: u64 = 12;\n    /// Lottery cancelled\n    const ELotteryCancelled: u64 = 13;\n    /// Lottery has no winning number\n    const ELotteryHasNoWinningNumber: u64 = 14;\n    /// Invalid lottery\n    const EInvalidLottery: u64 = 15;\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Module Structs - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    /*\n        The `Lottery` represents a lottery to be run.

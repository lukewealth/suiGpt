Give examples"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The entry modifier allows a function to be called directly from a programmable transaction block, as an 'entrypoint' to the module. When called this way, parameters passed to entry functions must be inputs to the transaction block, not the results of previous transactions in that block, and not modified by previous transactions in that block. Entry functions are also only allowed to return types that have drop. These restrictions prevent third parties using the scriptable nature of programmable transaction blocks to bypass the fact that entry functions are not otherwise allowed to be called from other modules. \n\npublic vs entry functions\nThe public modifier also allows a function to be called from a programmable transaction block. It additionally allows the function to be called from other modules, and does not impose the same restrictions on where the function's parameters can come from and what it can return, so in many cases public is the right way to expose your function to the outside world. entry is useful if:\n- You want strong guarantees that your function is not being combined with third-party module functions, in programmable transaction blocks. The canonical example of this is a swap protocol that does not want to interact with a flash loan provider: If the swap protocol exposes only entry functions to perform swaps, it will not be possible to pass in a flash loaned Coin, because that coin will be the output of some previous transaction.\n- You do not want the function's signature to appear in your module's ABI. public function signatures must be maintained by upgrades while entry function signatures do not.\n\nIt is also possible to create a public entry function, which can be called by other modules and by programmable transaction blocks but is restricted like an entry function in the latter case. This is rarely useful -- you probably only want one of public or entry. \n\nExample\n ```move\nmodule entry_functions::example {\n    use sui::object::{Self, UID};\n    use sui::transfer;\n    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};\n\n    struct Foo has key {\n        id: UID,\n        bar: u64,\n    }\n\n    /// Entry functions can accept a reference to the `TxContext`\n    /// (mutable or immutable) as their last parameter.\n    entry fun share(bar: u64, ctx: &mut TxContext) {\n        transfer::share_object(Foo {\n            id: object::new(ctx),\n            bar,\n        })\n    }\n\n    /// Parameters passed to entry functions called in a programmable\n    /// transaction block (like `foo`, below) must be inputs to the\n    /// transaction block, and not results of previous transactions.\n    entry fun update(foo: &mut Foo, ctx: &TxContext) {\n        foo.bar = tx_context::epoch(ctx);\n    }\n\n    /// Entry functions can return types that have `drop`.\n    entry fun bar(foo: &Foo): u64 {\n        foo.bar\n    }\n\n    /// This function cannot be `entry` because it returns a value\n    /// that does not have `drop`.\n    public fun foo(ctx: &mut TxContext): Foo {\n        Foo { id: object::new(ctx), bar: 0 }\n    }\n}```"}]}

The first way we will introduce is called object wrapping.\n\nLet's continue our transcript example. We define a new WrappableTranscript type, and the associated wrapper type Folder.\n\n````struct WrappableTranscript has store {\n    history: u8,\n    math: u8,\n    literature: u8,\n}\n\nstruct Folder has key {\n    id: UID,\n    transcript: WrappableTranscript,\n}````\n\nIn the above example, Folder wraps WrappableTranscript, and Folder is addressable through its id as it has the key ability.\n\n**Object Wrapping Properties**\n\nFor a struct type to be capable of being embedded in a Sui object struct, which will generally have the key ability, the embedded struct type must have the store ability.\n\nWhen an object is wrapped, the wrapped object is no longer accessible independently via object ID. Instead it would just be parts of the wrapper object itself. More importantly, the wrapped object can no longer be passed as an argument in Move calls, and the only access point is through the wrapper object.\n\nBecause of this property, object wrapping can be used as a way to make an object inaccessible outside of specific contract calls. For further info about Object wrapping, go check out here.\n\n **Object Wrapping Example**\n\nWe will implement an example of object wrapping to our transcript example, so that WrappableTranscript is wrapped by a Folder object, and so that the Folder object can only be unpacked by, and thus the transcript inside only accessible by an intended address/viewer.\n\n**Modify WrappableTranscript and Folder**\n\nFirst, we need to make some adjustments to our two custom types WrappableTranscript and Folder from the previous section\n\n1. We need to add the key ability to our type definitions for WrappableTranscript, so that they become assets and are transferrable.\n\nRemember that custom types with the abilities key and store are considered to be assets in Sui Move.\n\n````struct WrappableTranscript has key, store {\n        id: UID,\n        history: u8,\n        math: u8,\n        literature: u8,\n}````\n\n1. We need to add an additional field intended_address to the Folder struct that indicates the address of the intended viewer of the wrapped transcript.\n\n````struct Folder has key {\n    id: UID,\n    transcript: WrappableTranscript,\n    intended_address: address\n}````\n\n**Request Transcript Method**\n\n````public fun request_transcript(transcript: WrappableTranscript, intended_address: address, ctx: &mut TxContext){\n    let folderObject = Folder {\n        id: object::new(ctx),\n        transcript,\n        intended_address\n    };\n    //We transfer the wrapped transcript object directly to the intended address\n    transfer::transfer(folderObject, intended_address)\n}````\n\nThis method simply takes in a WrappableTranscript object and wraps it in a Folder object, and transfers the wrapped transcript to the intended address of the transcript.\n\n**Unwrap Transcript Method**\n\n````public fun unpack_wrapped_transcript(folder: Folder, ctx: &mut TxContext){\n    // Check that the person unpacking the transcript is the intended viewer\n    assert!(folder.intended_address == tx_context::sender(ctx), 0);\n    let Folder {\n        id,\n        transcript,\n        intended_address:_,\n    } = folder;\n    transfer::transfer(transcript, tx_context::sender(ctx));\n    // Deletes the wrapper Folder object\n    object::delete(id)\n    }````\n\nThis method unwraps the WrappableTranscript object from the Folder wrapper object if the method caller is the intended viewer of the transcript, and sends it to the method caller.\n\nQuiz: Why do we need to delete the wrapper object here manually? What happens if we don't delete it?\n\n**Assert**\n\nWe used the assert! syntax to verify that the address sending the transaction to unpack the transcript is the same as the intended_address field of the Folder wrapper object.\n\nthe assert! macro takes in two parameters of the format:\n\n````assert!(<bool expression>, <code>)\n````\n\nwhere the boolean expression must evaluate to true, otherwise it will abort with error code <code>.\n\n**Custom Errors**\n\nWe are using a default 0 for our error code above, but we can also define a custom error constant in the following way:\n\n````    const ENotIntendedAddress: u64 = 1;````\n\nThis error code then can be consumed at the application level and handled appropriately.\n\nHere is the second work-in-progress version of what we have written so far: WIP transcript.move\n\n"}]}

They may all come with different forms and sizes but they have one common trait: they sell something and display their wares openly for passersby to browse and engage with\n\nSui Kiosk is the digital version of these types of kiosk but for digital assets and collectibles. Sui Kiosk is a decentralized system for onchain commerce applications on Sui. Practically, Kiosk is a part of the Sui framework, and it is native to the system and available to everyone out of the box.\n\n**Why Sui Kiosk?**\n\nSui Kiosk is created to answer these needs:\n\n- Can we list an item on marketplace and continue using it?\n\n- Is there a way to create a \u201csafe\u201d for collectibles?\n\n- Can we build an onchain system with custom logic for transfer management?\n\n- How to favor creators and guarantee royalties?\n\n- Can we avoid centralization of traditional marketplaces?\n\n**Main Components**\n\nSui Kiosk consists these 2 main components:\n\n- Kiosk + KioskOwnerCap: Kiosk is the safe that will store our assets and display them for selling, it is implemented as a shared object allowing interactions between multiple parties. Each Kiosk will have a corresponding Kiosk Owner whoever holding the KioskOwnerCap. The Kiosk Owner still have the *logical ownership*\n over their assets even when they are *physically*\n placed in the kiosk.\n\n- TransferPolicy + TransferPolicyCap: TransferPolicy is a shared object defines the conditions in which the assets can be traded or sold. Each TransferPolicy consists a set of *rules*\n, with each rule specifies the requirements every trade must sastify. Rules can be enabled or disabled from the TransferPolicy by whoever owning the TransferOwnerCap. Greate example of TransferPolicy's rule is the royalty fees guarantee.\n\n**Sui Kiosk Users**\n\nSui Kiosk use-cases is centered around these 3 types of users:\n\n- Kiosk Owner (Seller/KO): One must own the KioskOwnerCap to become the Kiosk Owner. KO can:\n\nPlace their assets in kiosk.\nWithdraw the assets in kiosk if they're not *locked*\n.\nList assets for sale.\nWithdraw profits from sales.\nBorrow and mutate owned assets in kiosk.\n\n\n\n- Place their assets in kiosk.\n\n- Withdraw the assets in kiosk if they're not *locked*\n.\n\n- List assets for sale.\n\n- Withdraw profits from sales.\n\n- Borrow and mutate owned assets in kiosk.\n\n- Buyer: Buyer can be anyone who's willing to purchase the listed items. The buyers must satisfy the TransferPolicy for the trade to be considered successful.\n\n- Creator: Creator is a party that creates and controls the TransferPolicy for a single type. For example, authors of SuiFrens collectibles are the creators of SuiFren<Capy> type and act as creators in the Sui Kiosk system. Creators can:\n\nSet any rules for trades.\nSet multiple tracks of rules.\nEnable or disable trades at any moment with a policy.\nEnforce policies (eg royalties) on all trades.\nAll operations are affected immediately and globally.\n\n\n\n- Set any rules for trades.\n\n- Set multiple tracks of rules.\n\n- Enable or disable trades at any moment with a policy.\n\n- Enforce policies (eg royalties) on all trades.\n\n- All operations are affected immediately and globally.\n\n**Asset States in Sui Kiosk**\n\nWhen you add an asset to your kiosk, it has one of the following states:\n\n- PLACED - an item is placed inside the kiosk. The Kiosk Owner can withdraw it and use it directly, borrow it (mutably or immutably), or list an item for sale.\n\n- LOCKED - an item is placed and locked in the kiosk. The Kiosk Owner can't withdraw a *locked*\n item from kiosk, but you can borrow it mutably and list it for sale.\n\n- LISTED - an item in the kiosk that is listed for sale. The Kiosk Owner can\u2019t modify an item while listed, but you can borrow it immutably or delist it, which returns it to its previous state.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Note: there is another state called LISTED EXCLUSIVELY, which is not covered in this unit and will be covered in the future in advanced section\n\n"}]}

TransferPolicy is a shared object acting as a central authority enforcing everyone to check their purchase is valid against the defined policy before the purchased item is transferred to the buyers.\n\n````use sui::tx_context::{TxContext, sender};\nuse sui::transfer_policy::{Self, TransferRequest, TransferPolicy, TransferPolicyCap};\nuse sui::package::{Self, Publisher};\nuse sui::transfer::{Self};\n\nstruct KIOSK has drop {}\n\nfun init(witness: KIOSK, ctx: &mut TxContext) {\n    let publisher = package::claim(otw, ctx);\n    transfer::public_transfer(publisher, sender(ctx));\n}\n\n#[allow(lint(share_owned, self_transfer))]\n/// Create new policy for type `T`\npublic fun new_policy(publisher: &Publisher, ctx: &mut TxContext) {\n    let (policy, policy_cap) = transfer_policy::new<TShirt>(publisher, ctx);\n    transfer::public_share_object(policy);\n    transfer::public_transfer(policy_cap, sender(ctx));\n}````\n\nCreate a TransferPolicy<T> requires the proof of publisher Publisher of the module comprising T. This ensures only the creator of type T can create TransferPolicy<T>. There are 2 ways to create the policy:\n\n- Use transfer_policy::new() to create new policy, make the TransferPolicy shared object and transfer the TransferPolicyCap to the sender by using sui::transfer.\n\n````sui client call --package $KIOSK_PACKAGE_ID --module kiosk --function new_policy --args $KIOSK_PUBLISHER --gas-budget 10000000````\n\n- Use entry transfer_policy::default() to automatically do all above steps for us.\n\nYou should already receive the Publisher object when publish the package.

Let's export it for later use.\n\n````export KIOSK_TRANSFER_POLICY=<TransferPolicy object ID>\nexport KIOSK_TRANSFER_POLICY_CAP=<TransferPolicyCap object ID>````\n\n**Implement Fixed Fee Rule**\n\nTransferPolicy doesn't enforce anything without any rule, let's learn how to implement a simple rule in a separated module to enforce users to pay a fixed royalty fee for a trade to succeed.\n\n\ud83d\udca1Note: There is a standard approach to implement the rules. Please checkout the rule template here\n\n**Rule Witness & Rule Config**\n\n````module kiosk::fixed_royalty_rule {\n    /// The `amount_bp` passed is more than 100%.\n    const EIncorrectArgument: u64 = 0;\n    /// The `Coin` used for payment is not enough to cover the fee.\n    const EInsufficientAmount: u64 = 1;\n\n    /// Max value for the `amount_bp`.\n    const MAX_BPS: u16 = 10_000;\n\n    /// The Rule Witness to authorize the policy\n    struct Rule has drop {}\n\n    /// Configuration for the Rule\n    struct Config has store, drop {\n        /// Percentage of the transfer amount to be paid as royalty fee\n        amount_bp: u16,\n        /// This is used as royalty fee if the calculated fee is smaller than `min_amount`\n        min_amount: u64,\n    }\n}````\n\nRule represents a witness type to add to TransferPolicy, it helps to identify and distinguish between multiple rules adding to one policy. Config is the configuration of the Rule, as we implement fixed royaltee fee, the settings should include the percentage we want to deduct out of original payment.\n\n**Add Rule to TransferPolicy**\n\n````/// Function that adds a Rule to the `TransferPolicy`.\n/// Requires `TransferPolicyCap` to make sure the rules are\n/// added only by the publisher of T.\npublic fun add<T>(\n    policy: &mut TransferPolicy<T>,\n    cap: &TransferPolicyCap<T>,\n    amount_bp: u16,\n    min_amount: u64\n    \n) {\n    assert!(amount_bp <= MAX_BPS, EIncorrectArgument);\n    transfer_policy::add_rule(Rule {}, policy, cap, Config { amount_bp, min_amount })\n}````\n\nWe use transfer_policy::add_rule() to add the rule with its configuration to the policy.\n\nLet's execute this function from the client to add the Rule to the TransferPolicy, otherwise, it is disabled. In this example, we configure the percentage of royalty fee is 0.1% ~ 10 basis points and the minimum amount royalty fee is 100 MIST.\n\n````sui client call --package $KIOSK_PACKAGE_ID --module fixed_royalty_rule --function add --args $KIOSK_TRANSFER_POLICY $KIOSK_TRANSFER_POLICY_CAP 10 100 --type-args $KIOSK_PACKAGE_ID::kiosk::TShirt --gas-budget 10000000````\n\n**Satisfy the Rule**\n\n````/// Buyer action: Pay the royalty fee for the transfer.\npublic fun pay<T: key + store>(\n    policy: &mut TransferPolicy<T>,\n    request: &mut TransferRequest<T>,\n    payment: Coin<SUI>\n) {\n    let paid = transfer_policy::paid(request);\n    let amount = fee_amount(policy, paid);\n\n    assert!(coin::value(&payment) == amount, EInsufficientAmount);\n\n    transfer_policy::add_to_balance(Rule {}, policy, payment);\n    transfer_policy::add_receipt(Rule {}, request)\n}\n\n/// Helper function to calculate the amount to be paid for the transfer.\n/// Can be used dry-runned to estimate the fee amount based on the Kiosk listing price.\npublic fun fee_amount<T: key + store>(policy: &TransferPolicy<T>, paid: u64): u64 {\n    let config: &Config = transfer_policy::get_rule(Rule {}, policy);\n    let amount = (((paid as u128) * (config.amount_bp as u128) / 10_000) as u64);\n\n    // If the amount is less than the minimum, use the minimum\n    if (amount < config.min_amount) {\n        amount = config.min_amount\n    };\n\n    amount\n}````\n\nWe need a helper fee_amount() to calculate the royalty fee given the policy and the payment amount. We use transfer_policy::get_rule() to enquire the configuration and use it for fee calculation.\n\npay() is a function that users must call themselves to fulfill the TransferRequest (described in the next section) before transfer_policy::confirm_request(). transfer_policy::paid() gives us original payment of the trade represented by TransferRequest. After royalty fee calculation, we will add the fee to the policy through transfer_policy::add_to_balance(), any fee collected by the policy is accumulated here and TransferPolicyCap owner can withdraw later. Last but not least, we use transfer_policy::add_receipt() to flag the TransferRequest that this rule is passed and ready to be confirmed with transfer_policy::confirm_request().\n\n**Buy Item from Kiosk**\n\n````use sui::transfer_policy::{Self, TransferRequest, TransferPolicy};\n\n/// Buy listed item\npublic fun buy(kiosk: &mut Kiosk, item_id: object::ID, payment: Coin<SUI>): (TShirt, TransferRequest<TShirt>){\n    kiosk::purchase(kiosk, item_id, payment)\n}\n\n/// Confirm the TransferRequest\npublic fun confirm_request(policy: &TransferPolicy<TShirt>, req: TransferRequest<TShirt>) {\n    transfer_policy::confirm_request(policy, req);\n}````\n\nWhen buyers buy the asset by using kiosk::purchase() API, an item is returned alongside with a TransferRequest. TransferRequest is a hot potato forcing us to consume it through transfer_policy::confirm_request(). transfer_policy::confirm_request()'s job is to verify whether all the rules configured and enabled in the TransferPolicy are complied by the users. If one of the enabled rules are not satisfied, then transfer_policy::confirm_request() throws error leading to the failure of the transaction. As a consequence, the item is not under your ownership even if you tried to transfer the item to your account before transfer_policy::confirm_request().\n\n\ud83d\udca1Note: The users must compose a PTB with all necessary calls to ensure the TransferRequest is valid before confirm_request() call.\n\nThe flow can be illustrated as follow:\n\nBuyer -> kiosk::purchase() -> Item + TransferRequest -> Subsequent calls to fulfill TransferRequest -> transfer_policy::confirm_request() -> Transfer Item under ownership\n\n**Kiosk Full Flow Example**\n\nRecall from the previous section, the item must be placed inside the kiosk, then it must be listed to become sellable. Assuming the item is already listed with price 10_000 MIST, let's export the listed item as terminal variable.\n\n````export KIOSK_TSHIRT=<Object ID of the listed TShirt>````\n\nLet's build a PTB to execute a trade. The flow is straightforward, we buy the listed item from the kiosk, the item and TransferRequest is returned, then, we call fixed_royalty_fee::pay to fulfill the TransferRequest, we confirm the TransferRequest with confirm_request() before finally transfer the item to the buyer.\n\n````sui client ptb \n--assign price 10000 \n--split-coins gas \"[price]\" \n--assign coin \n--move-call $KIOSK_PACKAGE_ID::kiosk::buy @$KIOSK @$KIOSK_TSHIRT coin.0 \n--assign buy_res \n--move-call $KIOSK_PACKAGE_ID::fixed_royalty_rule::fee_amount \"<$KIOSK_PACKAGE_ID::kiosk::TShirt>\" @$KIOSK_TRANSFER_POLICY price \n--assign fee_amount \n--split-coins gas \"[fee_amount]\"\n--assign coin \n--move-call $KIOSK_PACKAGE_ID::fixed_royalty_rule::pay \"<$KIOSK_PACKAGE_ID::kiosk::TShirt>\" @$KIOSK_TRANSFER_POLICY buy_res.1 coin.0 \n--move-call $KIOSK_PACKAGE_ID::kiosk::confirm_request  @$KIOSK_TRANSFER_POLICY buy_res.1 \n--move-call 0x2::transfer::public_transfer \"<$KIOSK_PACKAGE_ID::kiosk::TShirt>\" buy_res.0 <buyer address> \n--gas-budget 10000000````\n\n"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "SuiAI is a chat agent that is proficient in the Move smart contract language"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me more about creating a Rule for a Transfer Policy."},{"role": "assistant","content": "**Creating a Rule: Guide**\n\nWhen an item is purchased in a Kiosk, a TransferRequest potato is created, and the only way to resolve it and unblock the transaction is to confirm the request in the matching TransferPolicy. This guide explains how TransferPolicy works and how new rules can be implemented and added into a policy.\n\n**Basics**\n\nAn item of a type T can only be traded in Kiosks if the TransferPolicy for T exists and available to the buyer. This requirement is based on a simple fact that the TransferRequest issued on purchase must be resolved in a matching TransferPolicy and if there isn't one or buyer can't access it, the transaction will fail.\n\nThis system was designed to give maximum freedom and flexibility for creators: by taking the transfer policy logic out of the trading primitive we make sure that the policies can be set only by creators, and as long as the trading primitive is used, enforcements are under their control. Effectively creators became closer to the trading ecosystem and got an important and solid role in the process.\n\n**Architecture**\n\nBy default, a single TransferPolicy does not enforce anything - if a buyer attempts to confirm their TransferRequest, it will go through. However, the system allows setting so-called \"Rules\". Their logic is simple: someone can publish a new rule module, for example \"fixed fee\", and let it be \"added\" or \"set\" for the TransferPolicy. Once the Rule is added, TransferRequest needs to collect a TransferReceipt marking that the requiement specified in the Rule was completed.\n\n[TODO]\n\n- Once a Rule is added to the TransferPolicy, every TransferRequest going to the policy must have a matching Receipt\n\n**Rule structure: Dummy**\n\nEvery rule would follow the same structure and implement required types:\n\n1. RuleWitness struct\n2. Config struct stored in the TransferPolicy\n3. \"set\" function which adds the Rule to the TP\n4. an action function which adds a Receipt to the TransferRequest\n\n\nImportant: there's no need to implement \"unset\" - any rule can be removed at any time as defined in the TransferPolicy module and guaranteed by the set of constraints on the rule Config (store + drop)\n\n\n````module examples::dummy_rule {\n    use sui::coin::Coin;\n    use sui::sui::SUI;\n    use sui::transfer_policy::{\n        Self as policy,\n        TransferPolicy,\n        TransferPolicyCap,\n        TransferRequest\n    };\n\n    /// The Rule Witness; has no fields and is used as a\n    /// static authorization method for the rule.\n    struct Rule has drop {}\n\n    /// Configuration struct with any fields (as long as it\n    /// has `drop`). Managed by the Rule module.\n    struct Config has store, drop {}\n\n    /// Function that adds a Rule to the `TransferPolicy`.\n    /// Requires `TransferPolicyCap` to make sure the rules are\n    /// added only by the publisher of T.\n    public fun set<T>(\n        policy: &mut TransferPolicy<T>,\n        cap: &TransferPolicyCap<T>\n    ) {\n        policy::add_rule(Rule {}, policy, cap, Config {})\n    }\n\n    /// Action function - perform a certain action (any, really)\n    /// and pass in the `TransferRequest` so it gets the Receipt.\n    /// Receipt is a Rule Witness, so there's no way to create\n    /// it anywhere else but in this module.\n    ///\n    /// This example also illustrates that Rules can add Coin<SUI>\n    /// to the balance of the TransferPolicy allowing creators to\n    /// collect fees.\n    public fun pay<T>(\n        policy: &mut TransferPolicy<T>,\n        request: &mut TransferRequest<T>,\n        payment: Coin<SUI>\n    ) {\n        policy::add_to_balance(Rule {}, policy, payment);\n        policy::add_receipt(Rule {}, request);\n    }\n}````\n\nThis module contains no configuration and requires a Coin<SUI> of any value (even \"0\"), so it's easy to imagine that every buyer would create a zero Coin and pass it to get the Receipt. The only thing this Rule module is good for is illustration and a skeleton. Goes without saying but this code should never be used in production.\n\n**Reading the Request: Royalty**\n\nTo implement a percentage-based fee (a very common scenario - royalty fee), a Rule module needs to know the price for which an item was purchased. And the TransferRequest contains some information which can be used in this and other scenarios:\n\n1. Item ID\n2. Amount paid (SUI)\n3. From ID - the object which was used for selling (eg Kiosk)\n\n\nTo provide access to these fields, the sui::transfer_policy module has a set of getter functions which are available to anyone: \"paid()\", \"item()\" and \"from()\"\n\n\n````module examples::royalty_rule {\n    // skipping dependencies\n    const MAX_BP: u16 = 10_000;\n\n    struct Rule has drop {}\n\n    /// In this implementation Rule has a configuration - `amount_bp`\n    /// which is the percentage of the `paid` in basis points.\n    struct Config has store, drop { amount_bp: u16 }\n\n    /// When a Rule is added, configuration details are specified\n    public fun set<T>(\n        policy: &mut TransferPolicy<T>,\n        cap: &TransferPolicyCap<T>,\n        amount_bp: u16\n    ) {\n        assert!(amount_bp <= MAX_BP, 0);\n        policy::add_rule(Rule {}, policy, cap, Config { amount_bp })\n    }\n\n    /// To get the Receipt, the buyer must call this function and pay\n    /// the required amount; the amount is calculated dynamically and\n    /// it is more convenient to use a mutable reference\n    public fun pay<T>(\n        policy: &mut TransferPolicy<T>,\n        request: &mut TransferRequest<T>,\n        payment: &mut Coin<SUI>,\n        ctx: &mut TxContext\n    ) {\n        // using the getter to read the paid amount\n        let paid = policy::paid(request);\n        let config: &Config = policy::get_rule(Rule {}, policy);\n        let amount = (((paid as u128) * (config.amount_bp as u128) / MAX_BP) as u64);\n        assert!(coin::value(payment) >= amount, EInsufficientAmount);\n\n        let fee = coin::split(payment, amount, ctx);\n        policy::add_to_balance(Rule {}, policy, fee);\n        policy::add_receipt(Rule {}, request)\n    }\n}````\n\n**Time is also Money**\n\nRules don't need to be only for payments and fees. Some might allow trading before or after a certain time. Since Rules are not standardized and can use anything, developers can encode logic around using any objects.\n\n````module examples::time_rule {\n    // skipping some dependencies\n    use sui::clock::{Self, Clock};\n\n    struct Rule has drop {}\n    struct Config has store, drop { start_time: u64 }\n\n    /// Start time is yet to come\n    const ETooSoon: u64 = 0;\n\n    /// Add a Rule that enables purchases after a certain time\n    public fun set<T>(/* skip default fields */, start_time: u64) {\n        policy::add_rule(Rule {}, policy, cap, Config { start_time })\n    }\n\n    /// Pass in the Clock and prove that current time value is higher\n    /// than the `start_time`\n    public fun confirm_time<T>(\n        policy: &TransferPolicy<T>,\n        request: &mut TransferRequest<T>,\n        clock: &Clock\n    ) {\n        let config: &Config = policy::get_rule(Rule {}, policy)\n        assert!(clock::timestamp_ms(clock) >= config.start_time, ETooSoon);\n        policy::add_receipt(Rule {}, request)\n    }\n}````\n\n**Generalizing approach: Witness policy**\n\nSui Move has two main ways for authorizing an action: static - by using the Witness pattern, and dynamic - via the Capability pattern. With a small addition of type parameters to the Rule, it is possible to create a generic Rule which will not only vary by configuration but also by the type of the Rule.\n\n````module examples::witness_rule {\n    // skipping dependencies\n\n    /// Rule is either not set or the Witness does not match the expectation\n    const ERuleNotSet: u64 = 0;\n\n    /// This Rule requires a witness of type W, see the implementation\n    struct Rule<phantom W> has drop {}\n    struct Config has store, drop {}\n\n    /// No special arguments are required to set this Rule, but the\n    /// publisher now needs to specify a Witness type\n    public fun set<T, W>(/* .... */) {\n        policy::add_rule(Rule<W> {}, policy, cap, Config {})\n    }\n\n    /// To confirm the action, buyer needs to pass in a witness\n    /// which should be acquired either by calling some function or\n    /// integrated into a more specific hook of a marketplace /\n    /// trading module\n    public fun confirm<T, W>(\n        _: W,\n        policy: &TransferPolicy<T>,\n        request: &mut TransferRequest<T>\n    ) {\n        assert!(policy::has_rule<T, Rule<W>>(policy), ERuleNotSet);\n        policy::add_receipt(Rule<W> {}, request)\n    }\n}````\n\nThe \"witness_rule\" is very generic and can be used to require a custom Witness depending on the settings. It is a simple and yet a powerful way to link a custom marketplace / trading logic to the TransferPolicy. With a slight modification, the rule can be turned into a generic Capability requirement (basically any object, even a TransferPolicy for a different type or a TransferRequest - no limit to what could be done).\n\n````module examples::capability_rule {\n    // skipping dependencies\n\n    /// Changing the type parameter name for better readability\n    struct Rule<phantom Cap> has drop {}\n    struct Config {}\n\n    /// Absolutely identical to the witness setting\n    public fun set<T, Cap>(/* ... *) {\n        policy::add_rule(Rule<Cap> {}, policy, cap, Config {})\n    }\n\n    /// Almost the same with the Witness requirement, only now we\n    /// require a reference to the type.\n    public fun confirm<T, Cap>(\n        cap: &Cap,\n        /* ... */\n    ) {\n        assert!(policy::has_rule<T, Rule<Cap>>(policy), ERuleNotSet);\n        policy::add_receipt(Rule<Cap> {}, request)\n    }\n}````\n\n"}]}

Users can purchase items from shops and will receive a \n    purchased item receipt for each item purchased.\n\n    Shops: \n        A Shop is a global shared object that is managed by the shop owner. The shop object holds \n        items and the balance of SUI coins in the shop. \n    \n    Shop ownership: \n        Ownership of the Shop object is represented by holding the shop owner capability object. \n        The shop owner has the ability to add items to the shop, unlist items, and withdraw from \n        the shop. \n\n    Adding items to a shop: \n        The shop owner can add items to their shop with the add_item function.\n\n    Purchasing an item: \n        Anyone has the ability to purchase an item that is listed. When an item is purchased, the \n        buyer will receive a separate purchased item receipt for each item purchased. The purchased \n        item receipt is a object that is owned by the buyer and is used to represent a purchased \n        item.\n\n        The buyer must provide a payment coin for the item. The payment coin must be equal to or \n        greater than the price of the item. If the payment coin is greater than the price of the\n        item, the change will be left in the payment coin. \n\n        The profit from the sale of the item will be added to the shop balance. \n\n        The available supply of the item will be decreased by the quantity purchased. If the \n        available supply of the item is 0, the item will be unlisted.\n\n    Unlisting an item: \n        The shop owner can unlist an item from their shop with the unlist_item function. When an \n        item is unlisted, it will no longer be available for purchase.\n\n    Withdrawing from a shop: \n        The shop owner can withdraw SUI from their shop with the withdraw_from_shop function. The shop \n        owner can withdraw any amount from their shop that is equal to or below the total amount in \n        the shop. The amount withdrawn will be sent to the recipient address specified.    \n*/\nmodule example::marketplace {\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Dependencies\n    //==============================================================================================\n    use sui::coin;\n    use sui::event;\n    use std::vector;\n    use sui::sui::SUI;\n    use sui::transfer;\n    use sui::url::{Self, Url};\n    use sui::object::{Self, UID, ID};\n    use sui::tx_context::{Self,TxContext};\n    use std::string::{Self, String};\n    use sui::balance::{Self, Balance};\n\n    #[test_only]\n    use sui::test_scenario;\n    #[test_only]\n    use sui::test_utils::assert_eq;\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Constants - Add your constants here (if any)\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Error codes - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n    const ENotShopOwner: u64 = 1;\n    const EInvalidWithdrawalAmount: u64 = 2;\n    const EInvalidQuantity: u64 = 3;\n    const EInsufficientPayment: u64 = 4;\n    const EInvalidItemId: u64 = 5;\n    const EInvalidPrice: u64 = 6;\n    const EInvalidSupply: u64 = 7;\n    const EItemIsNotListed: u64 = 8;\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Module Structs - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    /*\n        The shop struct represents a shop in the marketplace.

Each Lottery is a shared object in which the creator receives a `WithdrawalCapability` \n    which can be used to withdraw the ticket sales once the lottery has been run and a winner has \n    been announced.\n\n    Creating a lottery:\n        A lottery is created using the `create` entry function which requires the transfer of an NFT \n        and other parameters for the lottery, such as length in time, prize per ticket and the upper \n        range of ticket numbers. A `Lottery` shared object is created which defines the parameters \n        of the lottery, holds the NFT prize and collects ticket payments. The `WithdrawalCapability` \n        allows the owner of this object to withdraw from the corresponding `Lottery` once it has \n        successfully run.\n    \n    Buying a ticket:\n        Once a lottery is created, any user can purchase a ticket and will receive a `LotteryTicket` \n        as proof of this purchase. The user can select any number that they wish as long as the \n        number hasn't already been sold and is within the range specified for the lottery. Payment \n        is in SUI and must be greater or equal than the price per ticket for the lottery.\n\n    Running the lottery:\n        Anyone can run the lottery if and only if the end date has passed. Tickets for the lottery \n        aren't available for purchase after the lottery has been run.  A pseudorandom number is \n        generated on chain and if there is a match to one of the bought tickets the lottery is \n        complete and the winner may collect their prize via `claim_prize`.  If no match is found \n        then the `run` entry function can be called until a winner is found. \n\n        A lottery cannot be run if it has already been run, if the end date has not passed, or if \n        the minimum number of participants has not been reached.\n\n    Cancellation period:\n        A lottery may be cancelled by anyone if the lottery has not been run and it is at least 7 \n        days past the end date. If the lottery has been cancelled, the creator can receive their NFT \n        back and players can refund their purchased tickets.\n    \n    Burning tickets:\n        At any point, the owner of a ticket can burn their ticket. \n    \n*/\nmodule overmind::nft_lottery {\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Dependencies - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n    use sui::event;\n    use sui::sui::SUI;\n    use sui::transfer::{Self};\n    use sui::object::{Self, UID, ID};\n    use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};\n    use sui::clock::{Self, Clock};\n    use sui::tx_context::TxContext;\n    use std::option::{Self, Option};\n    use sui::vec_set::{Self, VecSet};\n    use sui::balance::{Self, Balance};\n    \n    \n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Constants - Add your constants here (if any)\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Error codes - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n    /// No LotteryCapability\n    const ENoWithdrawalCapability: u64 = 1;\n    /// Invalid range\n    const EInvalidRange: u64 = 2;\n    /// In the past\n    const EStartOrEndTimeInThePast: u64 = 3;\n    /// Lottery has already run\n    const ELotteryHasAlreadyRun: u64 = 4;\n    /// Insufficient funds\n    const EInsufficientFunds: u64 = 5;\n    /// Ticket Already Gone\n    const ETicketAlreadyGone: u64 = 6;\n    /// No prize available\n    const ENoPrizeAvailable: u64 = 7;\n    /// Not winning number\n    const ENotWinningNumber: u64 = 8;\n    /// Ticket Not Available\n    const ETicketNotAvailable: u64 = 9;\n    /// Not withing conditions to abort\n    const ENotCancelled: u64 = 10;\n    /// Invalid number of participants\n    const EInvalidNumberOfParticipants: u64 = 11;\n    /// Ticket not found\n    const ETicketNotFound: u64 = 12;\n    /// Lottery cancelled\n    const ELotteryCancelled: u64 = 13;\n    /// Lottery has no winning number\n    const ELotteryHasNoWinningNumber: u64 = 14;\n    /// Invalid lottery\n    const EInvalidLottery: u64 = 15;\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Module Structs - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    /*\n        The `Lottery` represents a lottery to be run.

This module provides the functionality\n    for users to deposit and withdraw collateral, borrow and repay coins, and calculate their borrowing\n    health factor. This lending protocol is based on the NAVI lending protocol on the Sui network. \n\n    Lending protocol: \n        A lending protocol is a smart contract system that allows users to lend and borrow coins. \n        Users can lend out their coins by supplying the liquidity pools, and can borrow coins from the\n        liquidity pools. \n\n        This module is the basis for an overcollateralized lending protocol. This means that borrowers\n        need to have lended more coins than they are borrowing. This is to ensure that the lenders are\n        protected. \n\n    Depositing: \n        Lenders can deposit their coins to the liquidity pools at anytime with the deposit function.\n    \n    Withdrawing: \n        Lenders can withdraw the coins that they have lended out with the withdrawal function.\n\n        In production, the withdrawal function should ensure that withdrawing their collateral does \n        not result in the user's health factor falling below a certain threshold. More on this below.\n\n    Borrowing: \n        Borrowers can borrow coins from any available liquidity pools with the borrow function.\n\n        In production, the borrowing function should ensure that the borrower has enough collateral \n        to cover the borrowed amount. Ensuring that the health factor of this user is above a certain \n        threshold after the borrowing is typically good practice. More on this below.\n\n    Repaying: \n        Borrowers can repay coins they have borrowed with the repay function.\n\n    Admin: \n        Only the admin is able to create new pools. Whoever holds the AdminCap capablity resource can\n        use create_pool to create a pool for a new coin type. \n\n    Health factor: \n        To learn more about the health factor, please refer to Navi's documentation on health factors \n        here: https://naviprotocol.gitbook.io/navi-protocol-docs/getting-started/liquidations#what-is-the-health-factor\n\n        Note that the health factor should be calculated with a decimal precision of 2. This means that\n        a health factor of 1.34 should be represented as 134, and a health factor of 0.34 should be\n        represented as 34.\n\n        Example: \n            If a user has 1000 SUI as collateral and has borrowed 500 SUI, and the price of SUI is $1,\n            the health factor of the user would be 1.6 (returned as 160). This is with a liquidation\n            threshold of 80% (see below).\n\n            if a user has 1000 SUI and 34000 USDC as collateral and has borrowed 14000 FUD, and the \n            price of SUI is $7.13, the price of USDC is $1, and the price of FUD is $2.20, the health \n            factor of the user would be 1.06 (returned as 106). This is with a liquidationthreshold \n            of 80% (see below).\n\n    Liquidation threshold: \n        In production, each coin can have it's own liquidation threshold. These thresholds are considered\n        when calculating the health factor of a user.\n\n        In this module, the liquidation threshold is hardcoded to 80% for every coin. \n\n        More information on liquidation thresholds can be found in Navi's documentation here:\n        https://naviprotocol.gitbook.io/navi-protocol-docs/getting-started/liquidations#liquidation-threshold\n\n    Liquidation: \n        In production, if a user's health factor falls below the liquidation threshold, the user's \n        collateral is liquidated. This means that the user's collateral is sold off to repay the borrowed\n        amount. \n\n        In this module, the liquidation function is not implemented as it is out of scope. However, \n        being able to calculate the health factor of user is a crucial part of the liquidation process.\n\n    Price feed:\n        This module uses a dummy oracle to get the price of each coin. In production, the price feed \n        should be a reliable source of the price of each coin. \n\n        The price feed is used to calculate the health factor of a user.\n\n        The price and decimal precision of each coin can be fetched from the price feed with the get_price_and_decimals function. The coin's asset number is used to fetch the price and\n        decimal precision of the coin.\n\n    Decimal precision: \n        When relating USD values of different coins, it is important to consider the decimal precision\n        of each coin. This is because different coins have different decimal precisions. For this quest, \n        we assume that the decimal precision of each coin is between 0 and 9 (inclusive).\n\n        The decimal precision of each coin is fetched from the price feed get_price_and_decimals\n        function.\n*/\nmodule overmind::lending {\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Dependencies\n    //==============================================================================================\n    use sui::math;\n    use std::vector;\n    use std::debug;\n    use std::string;\n    use sui::transfer;\n    use overmind::dummy_oracle;\n    use sui::object::{Self, UID};\n    use sui::table::{Self, Table};\n    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};\n    use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};\n    use sui::balance::{Self, Balance};\n\n    #[test_only]\n    use sui::test_scenario;\n    #[test_only]\n    use sui::test_utils::{assert_eq, destroy};\n    #[test_only]\n    use sui::sui::SUI;\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Constants - Add your constants here (if any)\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Error codes - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n    \n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Module Structs - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    /*\n        This is the capability resource that is used to create new pools.

The module allows the collection manager \n    to mint NFTs and withdraw NFT sales, allows users to combine two NFTs into a new NFT and burn \n    NFTs.\n\n    Collection manager\n        The collection manager is the owner of the MinterCap object. The collection manager can mint\n        NFTs and withdraw NFT sales.\n\n    Minting NFTs\n        In this module, NFTs are minted by the manager of the collection. Minting an NFT requires a\n        payment of 1 SUI, which is sent to the MinterCap object. Any change is returned to the \n        sender of the transaction. The NFT is then transferred to the recipient. The NFT is \n        represented by the NonFungibleToken object.\n\n    Combining NFTs\n        Anyone that owns two or more NFTS can combine two NFTs into a new NFT. The two NFTs are \n        deleted and a new NFT is created and returned to the sender of the transaction. The new NFT \n        is represented by the NonFungibleToken object.\n\n        When combining two NFTs, the name of the new NFT is the concatenation of the names of the\n        two NFTs. For example, \n            - NFT1 name: \"NFT1\" \n            - NFT2 name: \"NFT2\" \n            - New NFT name: \"NFT1 + NFT2\" \n        \n        The description of the new NFT is as follows: \n            - \"Combined NFT of \" + NFT1 name + \" and \" + NFT2 name\n\n        For example, \n            - NFT1 name: \"NFT1\" \n            - NFT2 name: \"NFT2\" \n            - New NFT description: \"Combined NFT of NFT1 and NFT2\" \n\n        The new NFT image url will be provided by the sender of the transaction.\n\n    Burning NFTs\n        Anyone that owns an NFT can burn it. The NFT is deleted.\n\n    Withdrawing NFT sales\n        THe collection manager can withdraw the sales balance from the MinterCap object. The sales\n        balance is the total amount of SUI that has been paid for NFTs. \n\n    Public Getters\n        The module provides public getters for the name, description and image of an NFT. This can \n        be called by anyone on any existing NFT.\n*/\nmodule overmind::NonFungibleToken {\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Dependencies\n    //==============================================================================================\n    use sui::event;\n    use std::vector;\n    use sui::sui::SUI;\n    use sui::transfer;\n    use sui::url::{Self, Url};\n    use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};\n    use std::string::{Self, String};\n    use sui::object::{Self, UID, ID};\n    use sui::balance::{Self, Balance};\n    use sui::tx_context::{Self, TxContext};\n\n    #[test_only]\n    use sui::test_scenario;\n    #[test_only]\n    use sui::test_utils::assert_eq;\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Constants - Add your constants here (if any)\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Error codes - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n    const EInsufficientPayment: u64 = 1;\n    const ECodeForAllErrors: u64 = 2;\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Module Structs - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    /* \n        The NonFungibleToken object represents an NFT.

This module provides the \n    base functionality of an AMM that can be used to create a decentralized exchange on the Sui \n    blockchain.\n\n    AMM:\n        An AMM (Automated Market Maker) is a decentralized exchange that uses a mathematical formula\n        to price assets against each other. Liquidity providers deposit two assets into a liquidity\n        pool. The AMM uses a constant product formula to price assets against each other. The \n        constant product formula is: \n            x * y = k\n        where:\n            - x is the amount of the first asset\n            - y is the amount of the second asset\n            - k is a constant\n\n        The constant product formula is used to price assets against each other. For example, if\n        the liquidity pool contains 1000 coins of asset A and 1000 coins of asset B, then the\n        constant product formula is:\n            1000 * 1000 = 1000000\n\n        If a user wants to swap 100 coins of asset A for asset B, then the constant product formula\n        is:\n            (1000 + 100) * (1000 - x) = 1000000\n        where x is the amount of asset B that the user will receive. Solving for x, we get:\n            x = ~90.909\n\n        The user will receive 90.91 coins of asset B. The liquidity pool will now contain 1100 coins\n        of asset A and 909.09 coins of asset B. The constant product formula is:\n            1100 * 909.091 = 1000000\n\n        We can see that the constant product formula maintains the constant value (k) of 1000000.\n\n    Liquidity Pool Coins: \n        Each liquidity pool has a liquidity pool coin (LP coin) that represents the liquidity in the\n        pool. The LP coins are minted when liquidity is added to the pool and burned when liquidity is\n        removed from the pool. The LP coin is used to track the liquidity in the pool, to manage and \n        reward liquidity providers, as well as other uses. \n\n        Each liquidity pool will have its own LPCoin supply, which represents the total amount of LP\n        coins in circulation. The LPCoin supply is stored in the liquidity pool object.\n\n    Creating a liquidity pool: \n        Anyone has the ability to create a liquidity pool for two coins. The function takes two type \n        parameters, CoinA and CoinB, which are the types of the first and second coins in the \n        liquidity pool.\n\n        Creating a liquidity pool also requires the initial liquidity to be supplied to the pool. \n\n        The amount of LP coins to mint based on the provided liquidity is as follows: \n            sqrt(amount_coin_a * amount_coin_b) - 1000, where: \n                    - amount_coin_a is the amount of coin A being supplied\n                    - amount_coin_b is the amount of coin B being supplied\n                    - 1000 is the minimum liquidity that is locked in the pool and \n                        cannot be removed. This is to help stabilize the pool. \n                    - sqrt is the square root\n\n                The first 1000 LP coins are sent to the initial_lp_coin_reserve to lock the \n                liquidity. The remaining LP coins are sent to the liquidity provider.\n\n    Supply liquidity: \n        Liquidity can be supplied to a liquidity pool with the supply_liquidity function. The \n        function takes two parameters, coin_a and coin_b, which are the coins being supplied to the\n        liquidity pool. The function returns the LP coins that were minted for the liquidity pool.\n\n        The amount of LP coins minted is calculated with the following formula:\n            min(amount_coin_a * lp_coins_total_supply / amount_coin_a_reserve, \n                amount_coin_b * lp_coins_total_supply / amount_coin_b_reserve)\n            where:\n                - amount_coin_a is the amount of coin A being supplied\n                - amount_coin_b is the amount of coin B being supplied\n                - lp_coins_total_supply is the total supply of the LP coins for the liquidity \n                    pool\n                - amount_coin_a_reserve is the amount of coin A in the liquidity pool\n                - amount_coin_b_reserve is the amount of coin B in the liquidity pool\n                - min fetches the minimum value of the two values\n\n            In this case, all of the LP coins are sent to the liquidity provider. \n\n    Remove liquidity:\n        Liquidity can be removed from a liquidity pool with the remove_liquidity function. The \n        function returns the two coins that were removed from the liquidity pool.\n\n        The amount of coins being removed from the liquidity pool is calculated with the following\n        formula:\n            amount_coin_a = amount_lp_coins * amount_coin_a_reserve / lp_coins_total_supply\n            amount_coin_b = amount_lp_coins * amount_coin_b_reserve / lp_coins_total_supply\n            where:\n                - amount_lp_coins is the amount of LP coins being redeemed\n                - amount_coin_a_reserve is the amount of coin A in the liquidity pool\n                - amount_coin_b_reserve is the amount of coin B in the liquidity pool\n                - lp_coins_total_supply is the total supply of the LP coins for the liquidity pool\n\n        The two coins being removed from the liquidity pool are extracted from their respective\n        reserves in the liquidity pool and returned to the user. \n\n        The LP coins being redeemed are burned.\n\n    Swapping coins: \n        There are multiple functions for swapping coins based on the type of swap. The available \n        types of swaps are: \n            - swap_exact_a_for_b: Swaps an exact amount of CoinA for as much CoinB as possible. This\n                includes the minimum amount of CoinB that the user is willing to receive. If the \n                optimal (amount that satisfies the constant product formula) amount of CoinB is\n                less than the minimum amount of CoinB, then the swap should abort. This means that\n                the slippage was too high.\n            - swap_exact_b_for_a: Swaps an exact amount of CoinB for as much CoinA as possible. This \n                includes the minimum amount of CoinA that the user is willing to receive. If the \n                optimal (amount that satisfies the constant product formula) amount of CoinA is\n                less than the minimum amount of CoinA, then the swap should abort. This means that\n                the slippage was too high.\n            - swap_a_for_exact_b: Swaps as little CoinA as possible for an exact amount of CoinB. \n                This includes the maximum amount of CoinA that the user is willing to spend. If the\n                optimal (amount that satisfies the constant product formula) amount of CoinA is\n                greater than the maximum amount of CoinA, then the swap should abort. This means\n                that the slippage was too high.\n            - swap_b_for_exact_a: Swaps as little CoinB as possible for an exact amount of CoinA.\n                This includes the maximum amount of CoinB that the user is willing to spend. If the\n                optimal (amount that satisfies the constant product formula) amount of CoinB is\n                greater than the maximum amount of CoinB, then the swap should abort. This means\n                that the slippage was too high.\n\n        All of these functions follow the same formula for switching: \n            new_coin_a_reserve * new_coin_b_reserve = prev_coin_a_reserve * prev_coin_b_reserve\n            where:\n                - new_coin_a_reserve is the new amount of coin A in the liquidity pool with the \n                    swapped coins\n                - new_coin_b_reserve is the new amount of coin B in the liquidity pool with the \n                    swapped coins\n                - prev_coin_a_reserve is the previous amount of coin A in the liquidity pool\n                - prev_coin_b_reserve is the previous amount of coin B in the liquidity pool\n\n    Math: \n        When perform liquidity pool math calculations, values are cast to u128 to avoid overflow. \n        In production, it is best to check that the result of the math calculation is not too big\n        before casting back down to u64.\n*/\nmodule overmind::liquidity_pool {\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Dependencies\n    //==============================================================================================\n    use sui::math;\n    use std::debug;\n    use std::vector;\n    use sui::transfer;\n    use sui::object::{Self, UID};\n    use sui::tx_context::TxContext;\n    use sui::balance::{Self, Balance, Supply};\n    use sui::coin::{Self, Coin};\n\n    #[test_only]\n    use sui::test_scenario;\n    #[test_only]\n    use sui::test_utils::assert_eq;\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Constants - Add your constants here (if any)\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Error codes - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n    const EInsufficientLiquidity: u64 = 1;\n    const ESlippageLimitExceeded: u64 = 2;\n    const EInvalidSwapParameters: u64 = 3;\n    \n    //==============================================================================================\n    // Module Structs - DO NOT MODIFY\n    //==============================================================================================\n\n    /* \n        This struct represents the liquidity pool coin (LP coin) for a liquidity pool.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "SuiAI is a chat agent that is proficient in the Move smart contract language"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Give me an overview of the Sui Typescript SDK and how to use it."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Docs site**\n\nFor more complete docs, visit the Sui TypeScript SDK docs\n\n**Sui TypeScript SDK**\n\nThis is the Sui TypeScript SDK built on the Sui\nJSON RPC API. It\nprovides utility classes and functions for applications to sign transactions and interact with the\nSui network.\n\nWARNING: Note that we are still iterating on the RPC and SDK API before TestNet, therefore please\nexpect frequent breaking changes in the short-term. We expect the API to stabilize after the\nupcoming TestNet launch.\n\n**Working with Devnet**\n\nThe SDK will be published to npm registry with the\nsame bi-weekly release cycle as the Devnet validators and\nRPC Server. To\nuse the SDK in your project, you can do:\n\n````move$ npm install @mysten/sui.js````\n\nYou can also use your preferred npm client, such as yarn or pnpm.\n\n**Working with local network**\n\nNote that the latest tag for the published SDK\nmight go out of sync with the RPC server on the main branch until the next release. If you're\ndeveloping against a local network, we recommend using the experimental-tagged packages, which\ncontain the latest changes from main.\n\n````movenpm install @mysten/sui.js@experimental````\n\nRefer to the\nJSON RPC topic\nfor instructions about how to start a local network and local RPC server.\n\n**Building Locally**\n\nTo get started you need to install pnpm, then run the following command:\n\n````move# Install all dependencies\n$ pnpm install\n# Run the build for the TypeScript SDK\n$ pnpm sdk build````\n\n\nAll pnpm commands below are intended to be run in the root of the Sui repo.\n\n\n**Type Doc**\n\nYou can view the generated Type Doc for the\ncurrent release of the SDK at\nhttp://typescript-sdk-docs.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/.\n\nFor the latest docs for the main branch, run pnpm doc and open the\ndoc/index.html in your browser.\n\n**Testing**\n\nTo run unit tests\n\n````movepnpm --filter @mysten/sui.js test:unit\n````\n\nTo run E2E tests against local network\n\n````movepnpm --filter @mysten/sui.js prepare:e2e\n\n// This will run all e2e tests\npnpm --filter @mysten/sui.js test:e2e\n\n// Alternatively you can choose to run only one test file\nnpx vitest txn-builder.test.ts\n````\n\nTroubleshooting:\n\nIf you see errors like ECONNRESET or \"socket hang up\", run node -v to make sure your node\nversion is v18.x.x. Refer to this\nguide to switch node version.\n\nSome more follow up here is if you used homebrew to install node, there could be multiple paths to\nnode on your machine.\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/52676244/node-version-not-updating-after-nvm-use-on-mac\n\nTo run E2E tests against Devnet\n\n````moveVITE_FAUCET_URL='https://faucet.devnet.sui.io:443/gas' VITE_FULLNODE_URL='https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io' pnpm --filter @mysten/sui.js exec vitest e2e\n````\n\n**Connecting to Sui Network**\n\nThe SuiClient class provides a connection to the JSON-RPC Server and should be used for all\nread-only operations. The default URLs to connect with the RPC server are:\n\n- local: http://127.0.0.1:9000\n\n- Devnet: https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io\n\n````moveimport { getFullnodeUrl, SuiClient } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';\n\n// create a client connected to devnet\nconst client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('devnet') });\n\n // get coins owned by an address\nawait client.getCoins({\n\\towner: '0xcc2bd176a478baea9a0de7a24cd927661cc6e860d5bacecb9a138ef20dbab231',\n});````\n\nFor local development, you can run cargo run --bin sui-test-validator to spin up a local network\nwith a local validator, a fullnode, and a faucet server. Refer to\nthis guide for more information.\n\n````moveimport { getFullnodeUrl, SuiClient } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';\n\n// create a client connected to devnet\nconst client = new SuiClient({ url: getFullnodeUrl('localnet') });\n\n// get coins owned by an address\nawait client.getCoins({\n\\towner: '0xcc2bd176a478baea9a0de7a24cd927661cc6e860d5bacecb9a138ef20dbab231',\n});````\n\nYou can also construct your own in custom connections, with the URL for your own fullnode\n\n````moveimport { getFullnodeUrl, SuiClient } from '@mysten/sui.js/client';\n\n// create a client connected to devnet\nconst client = new SuiClient({\n\\turl: 'https://fullnode.devnet.sui.io',\n});\n\n// get coins owned by an address\nawait client.getCoins({\n\\towner: '0xcc2bd176a478baea9a0de7a24cd927661cc6e860d5bacecb9a138ef20dbab231',\n});````\n\n**Getting coins from the faucet**\n\nYou can request sui from the faucet when running against devnet, testnet, or localnet\n\n````moveimport { getFaucetHost, requestSuiFromFaucetV0 } from '@mysten/sui.js/faucet';\n\nawait requestSuiFromFaucetV0({\n\\thost: getFaucetHost('testnet'),\n\\trecipient:

Modules are used to group and isolate code,\nand all of the members of the module are private to the module by default. In this section you will\nlearn how to define a module, how to declare its members and how to access them from other modules.\n\n**Module declaration**\n\nModules are declared using the module keyword followed by the package address, module name and the\nmodule body inside the curly braces {}. The module name should be in snake_case - all lowercase\nletters with underscores between words. Modules names must be unique in the package.\n\nUsually, a single file in the sources/ folder contains a single module. The file name should match\nthe module name - for example, a donut_shop module should be stored in the donut_shop.move file.\nYou can read more about coding conventions in the\nCoding Conventions section.\n\n````movemodule book::my_module {\n    // module body\n}\n````\n\nStructs, functions, constants and imports all part of the module:\n\n- Structs\n\n- Functions\n\n- Constants\n\n- Imports\n\n- Struct Methods\n\n**Address / Named address**\n\nModule address can be specified as both: an address literal (does not require the @ prefix) or a\nnamed address specified in the Package Manifest. In the example below,\nboth are identical because there's a book = \"0x0\" record in the [addresses] section of the\nMove.toml.\n\n````movemodule 0x0::address_literal { /* ... */ }\nmodule book::named_address { /* ... */ }\n````\n\nAddresses section in the Move.toml:\n\n````move# Move.toml\n[addresses]\nbook = \"0x0\"\n````\n\n**Module members**\n\nModule members are declared inside the module body. To illustrate that, let's define a simple module\nwith a struct, a function and a constant:\n\n````movemodule book::my_module_with_members {\n    // import\n    use book::my_module;\n\n    // a constant\n    const CONST: u8 = 0;\n\n    // a struct\n    public struct Struct {}\n\n    // method alias\n    public use fun function as Struct.struct_fun;\n\n    // function\n    fun function(_: &Struct) { /* function body */ }\n}\n````\n\n**Further reading**\n\n- Modules in the Move Reference.\n\n"}]}

They're the base that makes up all\nother types. The primitive types are:\n\n- Booleans\n\n- Unsigned Integers\n\n- Address - covered in the next section\n\nHowever, before we get to the types, let's first look at how to declare and assign variables in\nMove.\n\n**Variables and assignment**\n\nVariables are declared using the let keyword. They are immutable by default, but can be made\nmutable using the let mut keyword. The syntax for the let mut statement is:\n\n````movelet <variable_name>[: <type>]  = <expression>;\nlet mut <variable_name>[: <type>] = <expression>;\n````\n\nWhere:\n\n- <variable_name> - the name of the variable\n\n- <type> - the type of the variable, optional\n\n- <expression> - the value to be assigned to the variable\n\n````movelet x: bool = true;\nlet mut y: u8 = 42;\n````\n\nA mutable variable can be reassigned using the = operator.\n\n````movey = 43;\n````\n\nVariables can also be shadowed by re-declaring.\n\n````movelet x: u8 = 42;\nlet x: u8 = 43;\n````\n\n**Booleans**\n\nThe bool type represents a boolean value - yes or no, true or false. It has two possible values:\ntrue and false which are keywords in Move. For booleans, there's no need to explicitly specify\nthe type - the compiler can infer it from the value.\n\n````movelet x = true;\nlet y = false;\n````\n\nBooleans are often used to store flags and to control the flow of the program. Please, refer to the\nControl Flow section for more information.\n\n**Integer Types**\n\nMove supports unsigned integers of various sizes: from 8-bit to 256-bit. The integer types are:\n\n- u8 - 8-bit\n\n- u16 - 16-bit\n\n- u32 - 32-bit\n\n- u64 - 64-bit\n\n- u128 - 128-bit\n\n- u256 - 256-bit\n\n````movelet x: u8 = 42;\nlet y: u16 = 42;\n// ...\nlet z: u256 = 42;\n````\n\nUnlike booleans, integer types need to be inferred. In most of the cases, the compiler will infer\nthe type from the value, usually defaulting to u64. However, sometimes the compiler is unable to\ninfer the type and will require an explicit type annotation. It can either be provided during\nassignment or by using a type suffix.\n\n````move// Both are equivalent\nlet x: u8 = 42;\nlet x = 42u8;\n````\n\n**Operations**\n\nMove supports the standard arithmetic operations for integers: addition, subtraction,\nmultiplication, division, and remainder. The syntax for these operations is:\n\nSyntaxOperationAborts If\n+additionResult is too large for the integer type\n-subtractionResult is less than zero\n*multiplicationResult is too large for the integer type\n%modular divisionThe divisor is 0\n/truncating divisionThe divisor is 0\n\n\nThe type of the operands must match, otherwise, the compiler will raise an error. The result of\nthe operation will be of the same type as the operands. To perform operations on different types,\nthe operands need to be cast to the same type.\n\n\n\n**Casting with as**\n\nMove supports explicit casting between integer types. The syntax for it is:\n\n````move(<expression> as <type>)\n````\n\nNote, that it requires parentheses around the expression to prevent ambiguity.\n\n````movelet x: u8 = 42;\nlet y: u16 = (x as u16);\n````\n\nA more complex example, preventing overflow:\n\n````movelet x: u8 = 255;\nlet y: u8 = 255;\nlet z: u16 = (x as u16) + ((y as u16) * 2);\n````\n\n**Overflow**\n\nMove does not support overflow / underflow, an operation that results in a value outside the range\nof the type will raise a runtime error. This is a safety feature to prevent unexpected behavior.\n\n````movelet x = 255u8;\nlet y = 1u8;\n\n// This will raise an error\nlet z = x + y;\n````\n\n**Further reading**\n\n- Bool in the Move Reference.\n\n- Integer in the Move Reference.\n\n \n**Address Type**\n\n\nTo represent addresses, Move uses a special type called address. It is\na 32 byte value that can be used to represent any address on the blockchain. Addresses are used in\ntwo syntax forms: hexadecimal addresses prefixed with 0x and named addresses.\n\n````move// address literal\nlet value: address = @0x1;\n\n// named address registered in Move.toml\nlet value = @std;\nlet other = @sui;\n````\n\nAn address literal starts with the @ symbol followed by a hexadecimal number or an identifier. The\nhexadecimal number is interpreted as a 32 byte value. The identifier is looked up in the\nMove.toml file and replaced with the corresponding address by the\ncompiler. If the identifier is not found in the Move.toml file, the compiler will throw an error.\n\n**Conversion**\n\nSui Framework offers a set of helper functions to work with addresses. Given that the address type\nis a 32 byte value, it can be converted to a u256 type and vice versa. It can also be converted to\nand from a vector<u8> type.\n\nExample: Convert an address to a u256 type and back.\n\n````moveuse sui::address;\n\nlet addr_as_u256: u256 = address::to_u256(@0x1);\nlet addr = address::from_u256(addr_as_u256);\n````\n\nExample: Convert an address to a vector<u8> type and back.\n\n````moveuse sui::address;\n\nlet addr_as_u8: vector<u8> = address::to_bytes(@0x1);\nlet addr = address::from_bytes(addr_as_u8);\n````\n\nExample: Convert an address into a string.\n\n````moveuse sui::address;\nuse std::string::String;\n\nlet addr_as_string: String = address::to_string(@0x1);\n````\n\n**Further reading**\n\n- Address in the Move Reference.\n\n"}]}

They are similar to arrays in\nother programming languages, but with a few differences. In this section, we introduce the vector\ntype and its operations.\n\n**Vector syntax**\n\nThe vector type is defined using the vector keyword followed by the type of the elements in\nangle brackets. The type of the elements can be any valid Move type, including other vectors. Move\nhas a vector literal syntax that allows you to create vectors using the vector keyword followed by\nsquare brackets containing the elements (or no elements for an empty vector).\n\n````move// An empty vector of bool elements.\nlet empty: vector<bool> = vector[];\n\n// A vector of u8 elements.\nlet v: vector<u8> = vector[10, 20, 30];\n\n// A vector of vector<u8> elements.\nlet vv: vector<vector<u8>> = vector[\n    vector[10, 20],\n    vector[30, 40]\n];\n````\n\nThe vector type is a built-in type in Move, and does not need to be imported from a module.\nHowever, vector operations are defined in the std::vector module, and you need to import the\nmodule to use them.\n\n**Vector operations**\n\nThe standard library provides methods to manipulate vectors. The following are some of the most\ncommonly used operations:\n\n- push_back: Adds an element to the end of the vector.\n\n- pop_back: Removes the last element from the vector.\n\n- length: Returns the number of elements in the vector.\n\n- is_empty: Returns true if the vector is empty.\n\n- remove: Removes an element at a given index.\n\n````movelet mut v = vector[10u8, 20, 30];\n\nassert!(v.length() == 3, 0);\nassert!(!v.is_empty(), 1);\n\nv.push_back(40);\nlet last_value = v.pop_back();\n\nassert!(last_value == 40, 2);\n````\n\n**Destroying a Vector of non-droppable types**\n\nA vector of non-droppable types cannot be discarded. If you define a vector of types without drop\nability, the vector value cannot be ignored. However, if the vector is empty, compiler requires an\nexplicit call to destroy_empty function.\n\n````move    /// A struct without `drop` ability.\n    public struct NoDrop {}\n\n    #[test]\n    fun test_destroy_empty() {\n        // Initialize a vector of `NoDrop` elements.\n        let v = vector<NoDrop>[];\n\n        // While we know that `v` is empty, we still need to call\n        // the explicit `destroy_empty` function to discard the vector.\n        v.destroy_empty();\n    }\n````\n\n**Further reading**\n\n- Vector in the Move Reference.\n\n"}]}

I hear they are quite different."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n**String**\n\nWhile Move does not have a built-in type to represent strings, it does have two standard\nimplementations for strings in the Standard Library. The std::string\nmodule defines a String type and methods for UTF-8 encoded strings, and the second module,\nstd::ascii, provides an ASCII String type and its methods.\n\n\nSui execution environment automatically converts bytevector into String in transaction inputs.\nSo in many cases, String does not to be constructed in the\nTransaction Block.\n\n\n\n**Strings are bytes**\n\nNo matter which type of string you use, it is important to know that strings are just bytes. The\nwrappers provided by the string and ascii modules are just that: wrappers. They do provide\nsafety checks and methods to work with strings, but at the end of the day, they are just vectors of\nbytes.\n\n````movemodule book::custom_string {\n    /// Anyone can implement a custom string-like type by wrapping a vector.\n    public struct MyString {\n        bytes: vector<u8>,\n    }\n\n    /// Implement a `from_bytes` function to convert a vector of bytes to a string.\n    public fun from_bytes(bytes: vector<u8>): MyString {\n        MyString { bytes }\n    }\n\n    /// Implement a `bytes` function to convert a string to a vector of bytes.\n    public fun bytes(self: &MyString): &vector<u8> {\n        &self.bytes\n    }\n}\n````\n\n**Working with UTF-8 Strings**\n\nWhile there are two types of strings in the standard library, the string module should be\nconsidered the default. It has native implementations of many common operations, and hence is more\nefficient than the ascii module, which is fully implemented in Move.\n\n**Definition**\n\nThe String type in the std::string module is defined as follows:\n\n````move// File: move-stdlib/sources/string.move\n/// A `String` holds a sequence of bytes which is guaranteed to be in utf8 format.\npublic struct String has copy, drop, store {\n    bytes: vector<u8>,\n}\n````\n\n**Creating a String**\n\nTo create a new UTF-8 String instance, you can use the string::utf8 method. The\nStandard Library provides an alias .to_string() on the vector<u8> for\nconvenience.\n\n````move// the module is `std::string` and the type is `String`\nuse std::string::{Self, String};\n\n// strings are normally created using the `utf8` function\n// type declaration is not necessary, we put it here for clarity\nlet hello: String = string::utf8(b\"Hello\");\n\n// The `.to_string()` alias on the `vector<u8>` is more convenient\nlet hello = b\"Hello\".to_string();\n````\n\n**Common Operations**\n\nUTF8 String provides a number of methods to work with strings. The most common operations on strings\nare: concatenation, slicing, and getting the length. Additionally, for custom string operations, the\nbytes() method can be used to get the underlying byte vector.\n\n````movelet mut str = b\"Hello,\".to_string();\nlet another = b\" World!\".to_string();\n\n// append(String) adds the content to the end of the string\nstr.append(another);\n\n// `sub_string(start, end)` copies a slice of the string\nstr.sub_string(0, 5); // \"Hello\"\n\n// `length()` returns the number of bytes in the string\nstr.length(); // 12 (bytes)\n\n// methods can also be chained! Get a length of a substring\nstr.sub_string(0, 5).length(); // 5 (bytes)\n\n// whether the string is empty\nstr.is_empty(); // false\n\n// get the underlying byte vector for custom operations\nlet bytes: &vector<u8> = str.bytes();\n````\n\n**Safe UTF-8 Operations**\n\nThe default utf8 method may abort if the bytes passed into it are not valid UTF-8. If you are not\nsure that the bytes you are passing are valid, you should use the try_utf8 method instead. It\nreturns an Option<String>, which contains no value if the bytes are not valid UTF-8, and a string\notherwise.\n\n\nHint: the name that starts with try_* indicates that the function returns an Option with the\nexpected result or none if the operation fails. It is a common naming convention borrowed from\nRust.\n\n\n````move// this is a valid UTF-8 string\nlet hello = b\"Hello\".try_to_string();\n\nassert!(hello.is_some(), 0); // abort if the value is not valid UTF-8\n\n// this is not a valid UTF-8 string\nlet invalid = b\"\\xFF\".try_to_string();\n\nassert!(invalid.is_none(), 0); // abort if the value is valid UTF-8\n````\n\n**UTF-8 Limitations**\n\nThe string module does not provide a way to access individual characters in a string. This is\nbecause UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding, and the length of a character can be anywhere from 1 to\n4 bytes. Similarly, the length() method returns the number of bytes in the string, not the number\nof characters.\n\nHowever, methods like sub_string and insert check character boundaries and will abort when the\nindex is in the middle of a character.\n\n**ASCII Strings**\n\nThis section is coming soon!\n\n"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "SuiAI is a chat agent that is proficient in the Move smart contract language"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are control flow statements and how are they used in the move programming language?."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n**Control Flow**\n\n\nControl flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They are used to\nmake decisions, to repeat a block of code, and to exit a block of code early. Move has the following\ncontrol flow statements (explained in detail below):\n\n- if and if-else - making decisions on whether to execute a block of\ncode\n\n- loop and while loops - repeating a block of code\n\n- break and continue statements - exiting a loop early\n\n- return statement - exiting a function early\n\n**Conditional Statements**\n\nThe if expression is used to make decisions in a program. It evaluates a\nboolean expression and executes a block of code if the expression is\ntrue. Paired with else, it can execute a different block of code if the expression is false.\n\nThe syntax for the if expression is:\n\n````moveif (<bool_expression>) <expression>;\nif (<bool_expression>) <expression> else <expression>;\n````\n\nJust like any other expression, if requires a semicolon, if there are other expressions following\nit. The else keyword is optional, except for the case when the resulting value is assigned to a\nvariable. We will cover this below.\n\n````move    #[test]\n    fun test_if() {\n        let x = 5;\n\n        // `x > 0` is a boolean expression.\n        if (x > 0) {\n            std::debug::print(&b\"X is bigger than 0\".to_string())\n        };\n    }\n````\n\nLet's see how we can use if and else to assign a value to a variable:\n\n````move    #[test]\n    fun test_if_else() {\n        let x = 5;\n        let y = if (x > 0) {\n            1\n        } else {\n            0\n        };\n\n        assert!(y == 1, 0);\n    }\n````\n\nHere we assign the value of the if expression to the variable y. If x is greater than 0, y\nwill be assigned the value 1, otherwise 0. The else block is necessary, because both branches must\nreturn a value of the same type. If we omit the else block, the compiler will throw an error.\n\n\nConditional expressions are one of the most important control flow statements in Move. They can use\neither user provided input or some already stored data to make decisions. In particular, they are\nused in the assert! macro to check if a condition is true, and if not, to\nabort execution. We will get to it very soon!\n\n**Repeating Statements with Loops**\n\nLoops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. Move has two built-in types of loops:\nloop and while. In many cases they can be used interchangeably, but usually while is used when\nthe number of iterations is known in advance, and loop is used when the number of iterations is\nnot known in advance or there are multiple exit points.\n\nLoops are helpful when dealing with collections, such as vectors, or when we want to repeat a block\nof code until a certain condition is met. However, it is important to be careful with loops, as they\ncan lead to infinite loops, which can lead to gas exhaustion and the transaction being aborted.\n\n**The while loop**\n\nThe while statement is used to execute a block of code as long as a boolean expression is true.\nJust like we've seen with if, the boolean expression is evaluated before each iteration of the\nloop. Just like conditional statements, the while loop is an expression and requires a semicolon\nif there are other expressions following it.\n\nThe syntax for the while loop is:\n\n````movewhile (<bool_expression>) { <expressions>; };\n````\n\nHere is an example of a while loop with a very simple condition:\n\n````move    // This function iterates over the `x` variable until it reaches 10, the\n    // return value is the number of iterations it took to reach 10.\n    //\n    // If `x` is 0, then the function will return 10.\n    // If `x` is 5, then the function will return 5.\n    fun while_loop(mut x: u8): u8 {\n        let mut y = 0;\n\n        // This will loop until `x` is 10.\n        // And will never run if `x` is 10 or more.\n        while (x < 10) {\n            y = y + 1;\n            x = x + 1;\n        };\n\n        y\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fun test_while() {\n        assert!(while_loop(0) == 10, 0); // 10 times\n        assert!(while_loop(5) == 5, 0);  // 5 times\n        assert!(while_loop(10) == 0, 0); // loop never executed\n    }\n````\n\n**Infinite loop**\n\nNow let's imagine a scenario where the boolean expression is always true. For example, if we\nliterally passed true to the while condition. As you might expect, this would create an infinite\nloop, and this is almost what the loop statement works like.\n\n````move    #[test, expected_failure(out_of_gas, location=Self)]\n    fun test_infinite_while() {\n        let mut x = 0;\n\n        // This will loop forever.\n        while (true) {\n            x = x + 1;\n        };\n\n        // This line will never be executed.\n        assert!(x == 5, 0);\n    }\n````\n\nAn infinite while, or while without a condition, is a loop. The syntax for it is simple:\n\n````moveloop { <expressions>; };\n````\n\nLet's rewrite the previous example using loop instead of while:\n\n````move    #[test, expected_failure(out_of_gas, location=Self)]\n    fun test_infinite_loop() {\n        let mut x = 0;\n\n        // This will loop forever.\n        loop {\n            x = x + 1;\n        };\n\n        // This line will never be executed.\n        assert!(x == 5, 0);\n    }\n````\n\n\nInfinite loops on their own are not very useful in Move, since every operation in Move costs gas,\nand an infinite loop will lead to gas exhaustion. However, they can be used in combination with\nbreak and continue statements to create more complex loops.\n\n**Exiting a Loop Early**\n\nAs we already mentioned, infinite loops are rather useless on their own. And that's where we\nintroduce the break and continue statements. They are used to exit a loop early, and to skip the\nrest of the current iteration, respectively.\n\nSyntax for the break statement is (without a semicolon):\n\n````movebreak\n````\n\nThe break statement is used to stop the execution of a loop and exit it early. It is often used in\ncombination with a conditional statement to exit the loop when a certain condition is met. To\nillustrate this point, let's turn the infinite loop from the previous example into something that\nlooks and behaves more like a while loop:\n\n````move    #[test]\n    fun test_break_loop() {\n        let mut x = 0;\n\n        // This will loop until `x` is 5.\n        loop {\n            x = x + 1;\n\n            // If `x` is 5, then exit the loop.\n            if (x == 5) {\n                break // Exit the loop.\n            }\n        };\n\n        assert!(x == 5, 0);\n    }\n````\n\nAlmost identical to the while loop, right? The break statement is used to exit the loop when x\nis 5. If we remove the break statement, the loop will run forever, just like the previous example.\n\n**Skipping an Iteration**\n\nThe continue statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration and start the next one.\nSimilarly to break, it is used in combination with a conditional statement to skip the rest of the\niteration when a certain condition is met.\n\nSyntax for the continue statement is (without a semicolon):\n\n````movecontinue\n````\n\nThe example below skips odd numbers and prints only even numbers from 0 to 10:\n\n````move    #[test]\n    fun test_continue_loop() {\n        let mut x = 0;\n\n        // This will loop until `x` is 10.\n        loop {\n            x = x + 1;\n\n            // If `x` is odd, then skip the rest of the iteration.\n            if (x % 2 == 1) {\n                continue // Skip the rest of the iteration.\n            };\n\n            std::debug::print(&x);\n\n            // If `x` is 10, then exit the loop.\n            if (x == 10) {\n                break // Exit the loop.\n            }\n        };\n\n        assert!(x == 10, 0); // 10\n    }\n````\n\nbreak and continue statements can be used in both while and loop loops.\n\n**Early Return**\n\nThe return statement is used to exit a function early and return a value. It is\noften used in combination with a conditional statement to exit the function when a certain condition\nis met. The syntax for the return statement is:\n\n````movereturn <expression>\n````\n\nHere is an example of a function that returns a value when a certain condition is met:\n\n````move    /// This function returns `true` if `x` is greater than 0 and not 5,\n    /// otherwise it returns `false`.\n    fun is_positive(x: u8): bool {\n        if (x == 5) {\n            return false\n        };\n\n        if (x > 0) {\n            return true\n        };\n\n        false\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fun test_return() {\n        assert!(is_positive(5) == false, 0);\n        assert!(is_positive(0) == false, 0);\n        assert!(is_positive(1) == true, 0);\n    }\n````\n\nUnlike in other languages, the return statement is not required for the last expression in a\nfunction. The last expression in a function block is automatically returned. However, the return\nstatement is useful when we want to exit a function early if a certain condition is met.\n\n"}]}

Successful execution applies all the changes made to\nobjects and on-chain data, and the transaction is committed to the blockchain. If a transaction\naborts, and changes are not applied. The abort keyword is used to abort a transaction and revert\nthe changes made so far.\n\n\nIt is important to note that there is no catch mechanism in Move. If a transaction aborts, the\nchanges made so far are reverted, and the transaction is considered failed.\n\n\n**Abort**\n\nThe abort keyword is used to abort the execution of a transaction. It is used in combination with\nan abort code, which will be returned to the caller of the transaction. The abort code is an integer\nof type u64 and can be any value.\n\n````movelet user_has_access = true;\n\n// abort with a predefined constant if `user_has_access` is false\nif (!user_has_access) {\n    abort 0\n};\n\n// there's an alternative syntax using parenthesis`\nif (user_has_access) {\n   abort(1)\n};\n````\n\nThe code above will, of course, abort with abort code 1.\n\n**assert!**\n\nThe assert! macro is a built-in macro that can be used to assert a condition. If the condition is\nfalse, the transaction will abort with the given abort code. The assert! macro is a convenient way\nto abort a transaction if a condition is not met. The macro shortens the code otherwise written with\nan if expression + abort.\n\n````move// aborts if `user_has_access` is `false` with abort code 0\nassert!(user_has_access, 0);\n\n// expands into:\nif (!user_has_access) {\n    abort 0\n};\n````\n\n**Error constants**\n\nTo make error codes more descriptive, it is a good practice to define error constants. Error\nconstants are defined as const declarations and are usually prefixed with E followed by a camel\ncase name. Error constants are no different from other constants and don't have special handling. So\ntheir addition is purely a practice for better code readability.\n\n````move/// Error code for when the user has no access.\nconst ENoAccess: u64 = 0;\n/// Trying to access a field that does not exist.\nconst ENoField: u64 = 1;\n\n/// Updates a record.\npublic fun update_record(/* ... , */ user_has_access: bool, field_exists: bool) {\n    // asserts are way more readable now\n    assert!(user_has_access, ENoAccess);\n    assert!(field_exists, ENoField);\n\n    /* ... */\n}\n````\n\n**Further reading**\n\n- Abort and Assert in the Move Reference.\n\n- We suggest reading the Better Error Handling guide to\nlearn about best practices for error handling in Move.\n\n"}]}

They are called from\nuser transactions and from other functions and group executable\ncode into reusable units. Functions can take arguments and return a value. They are declared with\nthe fun keyword at the module level. Just like any other module member, by default they're private\nand can only be accessed from within the module.\n\n````movemodule book::math {\n    /// Function takes two arguments of type `u64` and returns their sum.\n    /// The `public` visibility modifier makes the function accessible from\n    /// outside the module.\n    public fun add(a: u64, b: u64): u64 {\n        a + b\n    }\n\n    #[test]\n    fun test_add() {\n        let sum = add(1, 2);\n        assert!(sum == 3, 0);\n    }\n}\n````\n\nIn this example, we define a function add that takes two arguments of type u64 and returns their\nsum. The function is called from the test_add function, which is a test function located in the\nsame module. In the test we compare the result of the add function with the expected value and\nabort the execution if the result is different.\n\n**Function declaration**\n\n\nThere's a convention to call functions in Move with the snake_case naming convention. This means\nthat the function name should be all lowercase with words separated by underscores. For example,\ndo_something, add, get_balance, is_authorized, and so on.\n\n\nA function is declared with the fun keyword followed by the function name (a valid Move\nidentifier), a list of arguments in parentheses, and a return type. The function body is a block of\ncode that contains a sequence of statements and expressions. The last expression in the function\nbody is the return value of the function.\n\n````movefun return_nothing() {\n    // empty expression, function returns `()`\n}\n````\n\n**Accessing functions**\n\nJust like any other module member, functions can be imported and accessed via a path. The path\nconsists of the module path and the function name separated by ::. For example, if you have a\nfunction called add in the math module in the book package, the path to it will be\nbook::math::add, or, if the module is imported, math::add.\n\n````movemodule book::use_math {\n    use book::math;\n\n    fun call_add() {\n        // function is called via the path\n        let sum = math::add(1, 2);\n    }\n}\n````\n\n**Multiple return values**\n\nMove functions can return multiple values, which is useful when you need to return more than one\nvalue from a function. The return type of the function is a tuple of types. The return value is a\ntuple of expressions.\n\n````movefun get_name_and_age(): (vector<u8>, u8) {\n    (b\"John\", 25)\n}\n````\n\nResult of a function call with tuple return has to be unpacked into variables via let (tuple)\nsyntax:\n\n````move// Tuple must be destructured to access its elements.\n// Name and age are declared as immutable variables.\nlet (name, age) = get_name_and_age();\nassert!(name == b\"John\", 0);\nassert!(age == 25, 0);\n````\n\nIf any of the declared values need to be declared as mutable, the mut keyword is placed before the\nvariable name:\n\n````move// declare name as mutable, age as immutable\nlet (mut name, age) = get_name_and_age();\n````\n\nIf some of the arguments are not used, they can be ignored with the _ symbol:\n\n````move// ignore the name, only use the age\nlet (_, age) = get_name_and_age();\n````\n\n**Further reading**\n\n- Functions in the Move Reference.\n\n"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "SuiAI is a chat agent that is proficient in the Move smart contract language"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are Generics in the move programming language and how are they used?."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n**Generics**\n\nGenerics are a way to define a type or function that can work with any type. This is useful when you\nwant to write a function which can be used with different types, or when you want to define a type\nthat can hold any other type. Generics are the foundation of many advanced features in Move, such as\ncollections, abstract implementations, and more.\n\n**In the Standard Library**\n\nIn this chapter we already mentioned the vector type, which is a generic type that\ncan hold any other type. Another example of a generic type in the standard library is the\nOption type, which is used to represent a value that may or may not be present.\n\n**Generic Syntax**\n\nTo define a generic type or function, a type signature needs to have a list of generic parameters\nenclosed in angle brackets (< and >). The generic parameters are separated by commas.\n\n````move/// Container for any type `T`.\npublic struct Container<T> has drop {\n    value: T,\n}\n\n/// Function that creates a new `Container` with a generic value `T`.\npublic fun new<T>(value: T): Container<T> {\n    Container { value }\n}\n````\n\nIn the example above, Container is a generic type with a single type parameter T, the value\nfield of the container stores the T. The new function is a generic function with a single type\nparameter T, and it returns a Container with the given value. Generic types must be initialed\nwith a concrete type, and generic functions must be called with a concrete type.\n\n````move#[test]\nfun test_container() {\n    // these three lines are equivalent\n    let container: Container<u8> = new(10); // type inference\n    let container = new<u8>(10); // create a new `Container` with a `u8` value\n    let container = new(10u8);\n\n    assert!(container.value == 10, 0x0);\n\n    // Value can be ignored only if it has the `drop` ability.\n    let Container { value: _ } = container;\n}\n````\n\nIn the test function test_generic we demonstrate three equivalent ways to create a new Container\nwith a u8 value. Because numeric types need to be inferred, we specify the type of the number\nliteral.\n\n**Multiple Type Parameters**\n\nYou can define a type or function with multiple type parameters. The type parameters are then\nseparated by commas.\n\n````move/// A pair of values of any type `T` and `U`.\npublic struct Pair<T, U> {\n    first: T,\n    second: U,\n}\n\n/// Function that creates a new `Pair` with two generic values `T` and `U`.\npublic fun new_pair<T, U>(first: T, second: U): Pair<T, U> {\n    Pair { first, second }\n}\n````\n\nIn the example above, Pair is a generic type with two type parameters T and U, and the\nnew_pair function is a generic function with two type parameters T and U. The function returns\na Pair with the given values. The order of the type parameters is important, and it should match\nthe order of the type parameters in the type signature.\n\n````move#[test]\nfun test_generic() {\n    // these three lines are equivalent\n    let pair_1: Pair<u8, bool> = new_pair(10, true); // type inference\n    let pair_2 = new_pair<u8, bool>(10, true); // create a new `Pair` with a `u8` and `bool` values\n    let pair_3 = new_pair(10u8, true);\n\n    assert!(pair_1.first == 10, 0x0);\n    assert!(pair_1.second, 0x0);\n\n    // Unpacking is identical.\n    let Pair { first: _, second: _ } = pair_1;\n    let Pair { first: _, second: _ } = pair_2;\n    let Pair { first: _, second: _ } = pair_3;\n\n}\n````\n\nIf we added another instance where we swapped type parameters in the new_pair function, and tried\nto compare two types, we'd see that the type signatures are different, and cannot be compared.\n\n````move#[test]\nfun test_swap_type_params() {\n    let pair1: Pair<u8, bool> = new_pair(10u8, true);\n    let pair2: Pair<bool, u8> = new_pair(true, 10u8);\n\n    // this line will not compile\n    // assert!(pair1 == pair2, 0x0);\n\n    let Pair { first: pf1, second: ps1 } = pair1; // first1: u8, second1: bool\n    let Pair { first: pf2, second: ps2 } = pair2; // first2: bool, second2: u8\n\n    assert!(pf1 == ps2, 0x0); // 10 == 10\n    assert!(ps1 == pf2, 0x0); // true == true\n}\n````\n\nTypes for variables pair1 and pair2 are different, and the comparison will not compile.\n\n**Why Generics?**\n\nIn the examples above we focused on instantiating generic types and calling generic functions to\ncreate instances of these types. However, the real power of generics is the ability to define shared\nbehavior for the base, generic type, and then use it independently of the concrete types. This is\nespecially useful when working with collections, abstract implementations, and other advanced\nfeatures in Move.\n\n````move/// A user record with name, age, and some generic metadata\npublic struct User<T> {\n    name: String,\n    age: u8,\n    /// Varies depending on application.\n    metadata: T,\n}\n````\n\nIn the example above, User is a generic type with a single type parameter T, with shared fields\nname and age, and the generic metadata field which can store any type. No matter what the\nmetadata is, all of the instances of User will have the same fields and methods.\n\n````move/// Updates the name of the user.\npublic fun update_name<T>(user: &mut User<T>, name: String) {\n    user.name = name;\n}\n\n/// Updates the age of the user.\npublic fun update_age<T>(user: &mut User<T>, age: u8) {\n    user.age = age;\n}\n````\n\n**Phantom Type Parameters**\n\nIn some cases, you may want to define a generic type with a type parameter that is not used in the\nfields or methods of the type. This is called a phantom type parameter. Phantom type parameters\nare useful when you want to define a type that can hold any other type, but you want to enforce some\nconstraints on the type parameter.\n\n````move/// A generic type with a phantom type parameter.\npublic struct Coin<phantom T> {\n    value: u64\n}\n````\n\nThe Coin type here does not contain any fields or methods that use the type parameter T. It is\nused to differentiate between different types of coins, and to enforce some constraints on the type\nparameter T.\n\n````movepublic struct USD {}\npublic struct EUR {}\n\n#[test]\nfun test_phantom_type() {\n    let coin1: Coin<USD> = Coin { value: 10 };\n    let coin2: Coin<EUR> = Coin { value: 20 };\n\n    // Unpacking is identical because the phantom type parameter is not used.\n    let Coin { value: _ } = coin1;\n    let Coin { value: _ } = coin2;\n}\n````\n\nIn the example above, we demonstrate how to create two different instances of Coin with different\nphantom type parameters USD and EUR. The type parameter T is not used in the fields or methods\nof the Coin type, but it is used to differentiate between different types of coins. It will make\nsure that the USD and EUR coins are not mixed up.\n\n**Constraints on Type Parameters**\n\nType parameters can be constrained to have certain abilities. This is useful when you need the inner\ntype to allow certain behavior, such as copy or drop. The syntax for constraining a type\nparameter is T: <ability> + <ability>.\n\n````move/// A generic type with a type parameter that has the `drop` ability.\npublic struct Droppable<T: drop> {\n    value: T,\n}\n\n/// A generic struct with a type parameter that has the `copy` and `drop` abilities.\npublic struct CopyableDroppable<T: copy + drop> {\n    value: T, // T must have the `copy` and `drop` abilities\n}\n````\n\nMove Compiler will enforce that the type parameter T has the specified abilities. If the type\nparameter does not have the specified abilities, the code will not compile.\n\n\n````move/// Type without any abilities.\npublic struct NoAbilities {}\n\n#[test]\nfun test_constraints() {\n    // Fails - `NoAbilities` does not have the `drop` ability\n    // let droppable = Droppable<NoAbilities> { value: 10 };\n\n    // Fails - `NoAbilities` does not have the `copy` and `drop` abilities\n    // let copyable_droppable = CopyableDroppable<NoAbilities> { value: 10 };\n}\n````\n\n**Further Reading**\n\n- Generics in the Move Reference.\n\n"}]}

The former represents\noperational periods in the system and changed roughly every 24 hours. The latter represents the\ncurrent time in milliseconds since the Unix Epoch. Both can be accessed freely in the program.\n\n**Epoch**\n\nEpochs are used to separate the system into operational periods. During an epoch the validator set\nis fixed, however, at the epoch boundary, the validator set can be changed. Epochs play a crucial\nrole in the consensus algorithm and are used to determine the current validator set. They are also\nused as measurement in the staking mechanism.\n\nEpoch can be read from the transaction context:\n\n````movepublic fun current_epoch(ctx: &TxContext) {\n    let epoch = ctx.epoch();\n    // ...\n}\n````\n\nIt is also possible to get the unix timestamp of the epoch start:\n\n````movepublic fun current_epoch_start(ctx: &TxContext) {\n    let epoch_start = ctx.epoch_timestamp_ms();\n    // ...\n}\n````\n\nNormally, epochs are used in staking and system operations, however, in custom scenarios they can be\nused to emulate 24h periods. They are critical if an application relies on the staking logic or\nneeds to know the current validator set.\n\n**Time**\n\nFor a more precise time measurement, Sui provides the Clock object. It is a system object that is\nupdated during checkpoints by the system, which stores the current time in milliseconds since the\nUnix Epoch. The Clock object is defined in the sui::clock module and has a reserved address\n0x6.\n\nClock is a shared object, but it a transaction attempting to access it mutably will fail. This\nlimitation allows parallel access to the Clock object, which is important for maintaining\nperformance.\n\n````move// File: sui-framework/clock.move\n/// Singleton shared object that exposes time to Move calls.  This\n/// object is found at address 0x6, and can only be read (accessed\n/// via an immutable reference) by entry functions.\n///\n/// Entry Functions that attempt to accept `Clock` by mutable\n/// reference or value will fail to verify, and honest validators\n/// will not sign or execute transactions that use `Clock` as an\n/// input parameter, unless it is passed by immutable reference.\nstruct Clock has key {\n    id: UID,\n    /// The clock's timestamp, which is set automatically by a\n    /// system transaction every time consensus commits a\n    /// schedule, or by `sui::clock::increment_for_testing` during\n    /// testing.\n    timestamp_ms: u64,\n}\n````\n\nThere is only one public function available in the Clock module - timestamp_ms. It returns the\ncurrent time in milliseconds since the Unix Epoch.\n\n````moveuse sui::clock::Clock;\n\n/// Clock needs to be passed as an immutable reference.\npublic fun current_time(clock: &Clock) {\n    let time = clock.timestamp_ms();\n    // ...\n}\n````\n\n\n"}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "SuiAI is a chat agent that is proficient in the Move smart contract language"}, {"role": "user", "content": "What are capabilities?."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n**Pattern: Capability**\n\nIn programming, a capability is a token that gives the owner the right to perform a specific\naction. It is a pattern that is used to control access to resources and operations. A simple example\nof a capability is a key to a door. If you have the key, you can open the door. If you don't have\nthe key, you can't open the door. A more practical example is an Admin Capability which allows the\nowner to perform administrative operations, which regular users cannot.\n\n**Capability is an Object**\n\nIn the Sui Object Model, capabilities are represented as objects.\nAn owner of an object can pass this object to a function to prove that they have the right to\nperform a specific action. Due to strict typing, the function taking a capability as an argument can\nonly be called with the correct capability.\n\n\nThere's a convention to name capabilities with the Cap suffix, for example, AdminCap or\nKioskOwnerCap.\n\n\n````movemodule book::capability {\n    use std::string::String;\n    use sui::event;\n\n    /// The capability granting the application admin the right to create new\n    /// accounts in the system.\n    public struct AdminCap has key, store { id: UID }\n\n    /// The user account in the system.\n    public struct Account has key, store {\n        id: UID,\n        name: String\n    }\n\n    /// A simple `Ping` event with no data.\n    public struct Ping has copy, drop { by: ID }\n\n    /// Creates a new account in the system. Requires the `AdminCap` capability\n    /// to be passed as the first argument.\n    public fun new(_: &AdminCap, name: String, ctx: &mut TxContext): Account {\n        Account {\n            id: object::new(ctx),\n            name,\n        }\n    }\n\n    /// Account, and any other objects, can also be used as a Capability in the\n    /// application. For example, to emit an event.\n    public fun send_ping(acc: &Account) {\n        event::emit(Ping {\n            by: acc.id.to_inner()\n        })\n    }\n\n    /// Updates the account name. Can only be called by the `Account` owner.\n    public fun update(account: &mut Account, name: String) {\n        account.name = name;\n    }\n}\n````\n\n**Using init for Admin Capability**\n\nA very common practice is to create a single AdminCap object on package publish. This way, the\napplication can have a setup phase where the admin account prepares the state of the application.\n\n````movemodule book::admin_cap {\n    /// The capability granting the admin privileges in the system.\n    /// Created only once in the `init` function.\n    public struct AdminCap has key { id: UID }\n\n    /// Create the AdminCap object on package publish and transfer it to the\n    /// package owner.\n    fun init(ctx: &mut TxContext) {\n        transfer::transfer(\n            AdminCap { id: object::new(ctx) },\n            ctx.sender()\n        )\n    }\n}\n````\n\n**Address check vs Capability**\n\nUtilizing objects as capabilities is a relatively new concept in blockchain programming. And in\nother smart-contract languages, authorization is often performed by checking the address of the\nsender. This pattern is still viable on Sui, however, overall recommendation is to use capabilities\nfor better security, discoverability, and code organization.\n\nLet's look at how the new function that creates a user would look like if it was using the address\ncheck:\n\n````move/// Error code for unauthorized access.\nconst ENotAuthorized: u64 = 0;\n\n/// The application admin address.\nconst APPLICATION_ADMIN: address = @0xa11ce;\n\n/// Creates a new user in the system. Requires the sender to be the application\n/// admin.\npublic fun new(ctx: &mut TxContext): User {\n    assert!(ctx.sender() == APPLICATION_ADMIN, ENotAuthorized);\n    User { id: object::new(ctx) }\n}\n````\n\nAnd now, let's see how the same function would look like with the capability:\n\n````move/// Grants the owner the right to create new users in the system.\npublic struct AdminCap {}\n\n/// Creates a new user in the system. Requires the `AdminCap` capability to be\n/// passed as the first argument.\npublic fun new(_: &AdminCap, ctx: &mut TxContext): User {\n    User { id: object::new(ctx) }\n}\n````\n\nUsing capabilities has several advantages over the address check:\n\n- Migration of admin rights is easier with capabilities due to them being objects. In case of\naddress, if the admin address changes, all the functions that check the address need to be\nupdated - hence, require a package upgrade.\n\n- Function signatures are more descriptive with capabilities. It is clear that the new function\nrequires the AdminCap to be passed as an argument. And this function can't be called without it.\n\n- Object Capabilities don't require extra checks in the function body, and hence, decrease the\nchance of a developer mistake.\n\n- An owned Capability also serves in discovery. The owner of the AdminCap can see the object in\ntheir account (via a Wallet or Explorer), and know that they have the admin rights. This is less\ntransparent with the address check.\n\nHowever, the address approach has its own advantages. For example, if an address is multisig, and\ntransaction building gets more complex, it might be easier to check the address. Also, if there's a\ncentral object of the application that is used in every function, it can store the admin address,\nand this would simplify migration.

The context is a set of predefined variables that are\navailable to the program during execution. For example, every transaction has a sender address, and\nthe transaction context contains a variable that holds the sender address.\n\nThe transaction context is available to the program through the TxContext struct. The struct is\ndefined in the sui::tx_context module and contains the following fields:\n\n````move// File: sui-framework/sources/tx_context.move\n/// Information about the transaction currently being executed.\n/// This cannot be constructed by a transaction--it is a privileged object created by\n/// the VM and passed in to the entrypoint of the transaction as `&mut TxContext`.\nstruct TxContext has drop {\n    /// The address of the user that signed the current transaction\n    sender: address,\n    /// Hash of the current transaction\n    tx_hash: vector<u8>,\n    /// The current epoch number\n    epoch: u64,\n    /// Timestamp that the epoch started at\n    epoch_timestamp_ms: u64,\n    /// Counter recording the number of fresh id's created while executing\n    /// this transaction. Always 0 at the start of a transaction\n    ids_created: u64\n}\n````\n\nTransaction context cannot be constructed manually or directly modified. It is created by the system\nand passed to the function as a reference in a transaction. Any function called in a\nTransaction has access to the context and can pass it into\nthe nested calls.\n\n\nTxContext has to be the last argument in the function signature.\n\n\n**Reading the Transaction Context**\n\nWith only exception of the ids_created, all of the fields in the TxContext have getters. The\ngetters are defined in the sui::tx_context module and are available to the program. The getters\ndon't require &mut because they don't modify the context.\n\n````movepublic fun some_action(ctx: &TxContext) {\n    let me = ctx.sender();\n    let epoch = ctx.epoch();\n    let digest = ctx.digest();\n    // ...\n}\n````\n\n**Mutability**\n\nThe TxContext is required to create new objects (or just UIDs) in the system. New UIDs are\nderived from the transaction digest, and for the digest to be unique, there needs to be a changing\nparameter. Sui uses the ids_created field for that. Every time a new UID is created, the\nids_created field is incremented by one. This way, the digest is always unique.\n\nInternally, it is represented as the derive_id function:\n\n````move// File: sui-framework/sources/tx_context.move\nnative fun derive_id(tx_hash: vector<u8>, ids_created: u64): address;\n````\n\n**Generating unique addresses**\n\nThe underlying derive_id function can also be utilized in your program to generate unique\naddresses. The function itself is not exposed, but a wrapper function fresh_object_address is\navailable in the sui::tx_context module. It may be useful if you need to generate a unique\nidentifier in your program.\n\n````move// File: sui-framework/sources/tx_context.move\n/// Create an `address` that has not been used. As it is an object address, it will never\n/// occur as the address for a user.\n/// In other words, the generated address is a globally unique object ID.\npublic fun fresh_object_address(ctx: &mut TxContext): address {\n    let ids_created = ctx.ids_created;\n    let id = derive_id(*&ctx.tx_hash, ids_created);\n    ctx.ids_created = ids_created + 1;\n    id\n}\n````\n\n"}]}
